Operating Income: $522

Summary: Apple's financial health appears to be strong based on the data provided in the report. The company reported a net income of $786 million and an operating income of $522 million in fiscal year 2000, indicating profitability and the ability to generate substantial earnings. 

The company's gross margin remained relatively stable at 27.1% in 2000, compared to 27.6% in 1999, suggesting the company has been able to maintain its pricing power and control costs effectively. Additionally, the company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased by 25% to $4.027 billion in 2000, indicating a strong liquidity position.

The report also highlights the company's successful product launches, such as the iMac and iBook, which contributed to a 32% increase in Macintosh unit sales in 2000. This growth in unit sales, coupled with the company's ability to manage its operating expenses, has led to the improvement in its profitability.

However, the report also notes that the company's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 was disappointing, with net sales falling short of expectations. This, along with the company's plan to reduce inventory levels in the first quarter of fiscal 2001, suggests that the company may face some near-term challenges. Nonetheless, the overall financial data presented in the report suggests that Apple is in a strong financial position and has the potential to continue its growth and profitability in the long term.
