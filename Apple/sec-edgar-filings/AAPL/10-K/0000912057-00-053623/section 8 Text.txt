Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9 under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 5 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Because the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company's research and development expenditures, before any charges for in-process research and development, totaled $380 million, $314 million, and $303 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for "Apple-Registered Trademark-", the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple color logo, "Macintosh-Registered Trademark-," and numerous other product trademarks. In 1986, the Company acquired ownership of the trademark "Macintosh" for use in connection with computer products. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, no litigation has arisen out of any of these claims that has had, or is expected to have, an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company believes that any necessary patent or other rights could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the Company would prevail in any such challenge. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of such claims, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA The United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 52% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2000 came from operations inside the United States. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, Cork, Ireland, and Singapore and by external vendors in Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 10, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional information regarding the risks associated with international operations is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Global Market Risks," included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 6 SEASONAL BUSINESS Although the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it has historically experienced increased sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the school year. However, past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance. WARRANTY The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end user. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the Company's major markets. BACKLOG In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be given such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. EMPLOYEES As of September 30, 2000, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 8,568 employees and an additional 3,160 temporary employees and contractors. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company's headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, Cork, Ireland, and Singapore. As of September 30, 2000, the Company leased approximately 3 million square feet of space, primarily in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Leases are generally for terms of five to ten years, and usually provide renewal options for terms of three to five additional years. The Company owns its manufacturing facilities in Cork, Ireland, and Singapore, which total approximately 617,000 square feet. The Company also owns a 748,000 square-foot facility in Sacramento, California, which is used as a manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center. The Sacramento and Cork facilities also house customer call centers. In addition, the Company owns 930,000 square feet of facilities located in Cupertino, California, used for research and development and corporate functions. Outside the United States, the Company owns additional facilities totaling approximately 169,000 square feet. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are well maintained and in good operating condition. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors, and therefore believes it has adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products. 7 Information regarding critical business operations that are located near major earthquake faults is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Other Factors" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims, including those described below, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. FTC INQUIRY-PRADO V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. (AND RELATED ACTIONS) In October 1997, Apple began charging all U.S. non-education customers for live telephone technical support beyond 90 days after purchase of Apple products. In late 1997, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commenced an investigation into customer complaints that Apple's change in technical support practices was either unfair or contrary to earlier representations to certain customers. Four purported class action lawsuits were filed against Apple related to this change. During the fourth quarter of 1999, the regional and national offices of the FTC approved a settlement with the Company, and a settlement was approved by the Court in three of the class action suits. In November 1999, two appeals were filed objecting to the settlement and the settlement is stayed pending resolution of the appeals. MICROWARE SYSTEMS CORPORATION V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. Plaintiff, Microware Systems Corporation (Microware), filed this action against the Company on September 1, 1999, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Microware alleged that the Company's current release of its Mac OS operating system, Mac OS 9, infringed Microware's trademark for its real time operating system, OS-9. Microware asserted claims for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. On October 14, 1999, Microware filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from using the designation "Mac OS 9" and to order the Company to cancel and withdraw all packaging and advertisements that mention "Mac OS 9." The Company opposed the motion for preliminary injunction and filed a motion for summary judgment against all of Microware's claims. The Court denied Microware's request for a preliminary injunction and granted Apple's motion for summary judgment. Microware has filed an appeal which will be heard in January 2001. STERNBERG V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND GORDON ET AL. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. Plaintiff Sternberg filed this action against the Company on March 17, 2000 in the Santa Clara County Superior Court. The case is a purported nationwide consumer class action brought on behalf of certain purchasers of iMac DV and iMac DV SE computers. Plaintiff alleges that Apple engaged in false advertising, unfair competition and breach of warranty, among other causes of action, by marketing and selling a DVD player with iMac DV and iMac DV SE computers where the playback was unacceptable. A companion case, GORDON ET AL. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. was filed by largely the same plaintiffs on June 14, 2000. This case is essentially the same as Sternberg but with respect to a different computer model--the Power Macintosh G4. The Company has answered both complaints, denying all allegations and alleging numerous affirmative defenses. The Company has responded to written discovery and has produced documents. The parties have agreed to mediate the cases. The mediation is expected to occur at the end of January 2001. 8 PIERCE ET AL. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. Plaintiff Pierce filed this action on June 15, 2000 in Santa Clara County Superior Court. This case is a purported nationwide consumer class action brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's AirPort Card and AirPort Base Station ("AirPort System"). Plaintiffs allege that the Company engaged in false advertising and unfair business practices (among other causes of action) by advertising that the Airport System is Internet-ready and failing to disclose that the Airport System is incompatible with certain Internet service providers, primarily America Online. The Company has answered the complaint, denying all allegations and alleging numerous affirmative defenses. The Company has responded to written discovery. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. 9 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS The Company's common stock is traded on the over-the-counter market and is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol AAPL, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the symbol APPLE, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol APCD. As of December 1, 2000, there were 24,998 shareholders of record. On June 21, 2000, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a Common Stock dividend to shareholders of record as of May 19, 2000. All share price and per share data and numbers of Common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The Company did not pay cash dividends in either fiscal 2000 or 1999. The Company anticipates that, for the foreseeable future, it will retain any earnings for use in the operation of its business. The price range per share of common stock represents the highest and lowest prices for the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during each quarter.

During 2000, the Company recognized the cost of a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million. In 1997, the Company acquired NeXT Software, Inc., resulting in the allocation to in-process research and development of a charge of $375 million for acquired in-process technologies with no alternative future use. Also in 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets from Power Computing Corporation (PCC). The total purchase price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in 1997 as "termination of license agreement." ITEM 7.

This increase in Macintosh unit sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of iMac, the company's moderately priced desktop Macintosh system designed for the education and consumer markets, and the introduction of iBook, the Company's consumer and education oriented notebook computer introduced at the end of 1999. The Company sold approximately 2.2 million iMacs in 2000, an increase of approximately 400,000 units or 22% over iMac unit sales in 1999. During 2000, the Company sold approximately 545,000 iBooks. iBook contributed $809 million to net sales during 2000. The Company also experienced modest gains in combined unit sales of its professionally oriented Macintosh systems, PowerMacs and PowerBooks. Growth in net sales and unit sales was strong in all of the Company's geographic operating segments, particularly in Europe and Japan. PROFITABILITY The Company experienced improved profitability in 2000. Operating income before special charges rose 61% to $620 million in 2000 from $386 million in 1999. Improved profitability was driven by the 30% increase in net sales, stable overall gross margins in 2000 as compared to 1999, and a relatively modest increase in operating expenses before special charges of 18%. OPERATING TRENDS Despite overall increases during 2000 in net sales, unit sales, and profitability, the Company's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 was disappointing. Net sales during the fourth quarter fell short of the Company's expectations by approximately $180 million causing operating margin before special charges to fall to 4% for the quarter as compared to the 9% experienced during the first nine months of fiscal 2000. The fourth quarter revenue shortfall was primarily the result of three factors. First, fourth quarter net sales 12 of the G4 Cube, a new Macintosh system announced and introduced by the Company during the fourth quarter, did not meet the Company's expectations. In combination with related displays, G4 Cube sales were approximately $90 million short of expectations. Second, net sales in the Company's education market fell short of expectations by approximately $60 million. Third, although total fourth quarter Power Mac unit sales were close to expectations, the Company experienced an unanticipated mix shift towards lower priced Power Mac configurations resulting in lower than anticipated net sales for the quarter of approximately $30 million. The Company ended 2000 with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through of the Company's products during the fourth quarter. OUTLOOK The Company currently anticipates a significant sequential decline in quarterly net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to approximately $1.0 billion. This decline is anticipated because of a continued deterioration in demand experienced by the Company during the first two months of fiscal 2001, rebate programs and price cuts instituted during the first quarter that will cost the Company approximately $135 million, and a plan to reduce substantially by the end of the first quarter the level of inventory in the Company's distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $115 million of cancellation charges related to purchase orders for proprietary components due to the reduced sales outlook. As a result of these factors, the Company anticipates reporting a net loss, before the effect of any investment gains, in the range of $225 million to $250 million for the first quarter of 2001. For all of 2001, the Company anticipates net sales will decline as compared to 2000, falling in the range of $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion. The Company currently expects that it will be profitable, before the effect of any investment gains, during each of the last three quarters of 2001. The foregoing statements concerning the Company's anticipated operating results during the first quarter of 2001 and the Company's anticipated operating result for all of 2001 are forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon general economic conditions, market conditions within the PC industry, and the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly competitive market for personal computers. Some of the potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition are discussed throughout this Item 7, including the discussion under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." 13 NET SALES Net sales for geographic segments and Macintosh unit sales by geographic segment and by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in thousands): 2000 CHANGE 1999 CHANGE 1998 -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Americas net sales................................... $4,298 22 % $3,527 2 % $3,468 Europe net sales..................................... 1,817 38 % 1,317 2 % 1,295 Japan net sales...................................... 1,345 57 % 858 17 % 731 Asia Pacific net sales............................... 355 16 % 306 4 % 293 Other segments net sales............................. 168 33 % 126 (18)% 154 ------ ------ ------ Total net sales.................................... $7,983 30 % $6,134 3 % $5,941 ====== ====== ====== Americas Macintosh unit sales........................ 2,507 24 % 2,021 22 % 1,655 Europe Macintosh unit sales.......................... 1,110 53 % 724 23 % 588 Japan Macintosh unit sales........................... 730 39 % 524 35 % 389 Asia Pacific Macintosh unit sales.................... 211 18 % 179 37 % 131 ------ ------ ------ Total Macintosh unit sales......................... 4,558 32 % 3,448 25 % 2,763 ====== ====== ====== Power Macintosh unit sales........................... 1,329 3 % 1,296 2 % 1,266 PowerBook unit sales................................. 383 11 % 344 (19)% 427 G4 Cube unit sales................................... 107 -- -- -- -- iMac unit sales(a)................................... 2,194 22 % 1,802 68 % 1,070 iBook unit sales..................................... 545 -- 6 -- -- ------ ------ ------ Total Macintosh unit sales......................... 4,558 32 % 3,448 25 % 2,763 ====== ====== ====== - ------------------------ (a) Unit sales figures for iMac in 1998 include sales of the Company's previous consumer and education oriented Macintosh products. Net sales rose 30% to a total of $7.983 billion in 2000 as compared to 1999. The increase in net sales resulted directly from a 32% increase in Macintosh unit sales. Driving unit sales growth was a 51% increase in combined unit sales of the Company's consumer and education Macintosh systems, iMac and iBook, and a modest increase of 11% in combined units sales of the Company's professionally oriented Macintosh systems. Combined unit sales of iMac and iBook systems accounted for 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 and 60% in 2000. This trend highlights the increasing importance to the Company of its consumer and education markets. During 2000, the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, of $1,715 was relatively unchanged from 1999. This was due to increased unit sales of higher priced Power Mac, PowerBook, iBook, and G4 Cube systems offset by increases in unit sales of lower priced iMac systems. Additional comments regarding net sales for 2000 may be found above under the heading "Fiscal 2000 Overview." Net sales increased $193 million or 3% to $6.134 billion in 1999 compared to 1998. The primary source of this growth was an overall 25% increase in Macintosh unit sales, which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the Company's geographic operating segments. Offsetting the rise in unit shipments during 1999 was a decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system which fell 17% to $1,739 from $2,095 in 1998. The decline during 1999 in the average revenue per Macintosh system was attributable to lower pricing for both iMac and Power Mac products, which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower pricing. The decline was also attributable to the shift in the Company's unit mix toward lower-priced consumer products such that iMac units and comparable products comprised 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 versus 39% in 1998. 14 Net sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter by $222 million or 14%, and declined $220 million or 14% compared to the same period in 1998. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales declined 15% and 7% during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter of 1999 and the same period in 1998, respectively. The primary causes for these declines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4 processors from Motorola and production interruptions at vendors supplying PowerBooks and iBooks experienced during the last week of the fourth quarter of 1999 as a result of the earthquake in Taiwan on September 20, 1999. The shortage of G4 processors reduced Power Macintosh net sales by approximately $200 million during the fourth quarter of 1999. SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 10, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. AMERICAS Net sales and unit sales in the Americas segment increased 22% and 24%, respectively, during 2000 as compared to 1999. During 2000, the Americas segment represented approximately 54% and 55% of the Company's total net sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The growth of the Americas' net sales in 2000 was indicative of strong growth in unit sales of iMac and iBook and relatively flat unit sales of professionally oriented Macintosh systems. Net sales in the Americas segment increased 2% to $3.527 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 22%. This followed a 5% decline in net sales in the Americas between 1998 and 1997. During 1999, the Americas segment represented approximately 57% and 59% of the Company's total net sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The results experienced by this segment in 1999 reflect the overall trends experienced by the Company during 1999 of increasing Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system. EUROPE Net sales in the Europe segment increased 38% during 2000 driven by a 53% increase in Macintosh unit sales. Growth in unit sales resulted from a 96% increase in combined unit sales of iMac and iBook, and an increase of 19% in combined units sales of the Company's professionally oriented Macintosh systems. Net sales in the Europe segment increased 2% to $1.317 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 23%. This followed a 16% decline in net sales in the Europe segment between 1998 and 1997. Like the Americas segment, Europe's results in 1999 as compared to 1998 were indicative of strong growth in Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system. JAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC Net sales in the Japan segment increased 57% to $1.345 billion in 2000 as compared to 1999, while Japan's Macintosh unit sales increased 39%. The fact that Japan's net sales rose at a higher rate than its unit sales reflects several factors. First, iMac unit sales in Japan were relatively flat year-over-year. Second, unit sales of iBook, which generally carry a higher price than iMac units and which were first sold in Japan during 2000, accounted for approximately 17% of Japan's total Macintosh unit sales during 2000. Third, Japan saw a 43% increase in combined unit sales of the Company's professionally oriented Macintosh systems. 15 The majority of the increase in both net sales and unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment can be attributed to sales of the G4 Cube and iBook, both of which were introduced in the region during 2000. Macintosh unit sales and net sales in Asia, particularly in Japan, recovered during 1999 from the declines experienced in 1998. Net sales in the Japan segment increased 17% or $127 million to a total of $858 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. Macintosh unit sales in Japan increased 35% during 1999 compared to 1998 while Macintosh unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased 37%. The increases in net sales and Macintosh unit sales in both Japan and Asia Pacific are the result of strong iMac sales experienced by these operating segments, strong growth in Japanese consumer sales, and the general economic recovery experienced in the region. BACKLOG In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. GROSS MARGIN Gross margin was relatively stable during 2000 as compared to 1999, declining to 27.1% during 2000 from 27.6% during 1999. The half point decline is primarily the result of a shift in mix of unit sales away from the Company's higher priced, higher margin professionally oriented Macintosh systems towards its lower priced, lower margin consumer and education oriented Macintosh systems. Also contributing to the relative stability of its gross margin, the Company experienced relatively stable component pricing during 2000 as compared to 1999. Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1999 to 27.6% as compared to 24.9% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to declines in the cost of various components of the Company's products, improvements in manufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final assembly of certain of the Company's products, improved design of products leading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs, and relatively stable pricing of the Company's products over the last six months of 1999. During 1999, the Company was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily in 1998 and 1997 that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient distribution model for its products. There can be no assurance current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 16 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Company recognizes focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. Expenditures on research and development increased 21% or $66 million to $380 million in 2000 as compared to 1999. This followed a $11 million or 4% increase in 1999 as compared to 1998. Spending on R&D has remained at approximately 5% of net sales during each of the last three years. The overall increase in R&D spending over the last two years is directly related to increases in R&D headcount of approximately 13% over that time to support expanded product development efforts. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 17% to $1,166 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 and decreased to 15% of net sales in 2000 from 16% in 1999. This increase in total expenditures resulted from higher spending for promotional and marketing activities, increased sales expenses resulting from higher net sales, and a 21% increase in combined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end of 1999 to the end of 2000. Selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% to $996 million in 1999 as compared to 1998 and increased to 16% of net sales in 1999 from 15% in 1998. These increases are primarily the result of increased spending on marketing and promotional activities throughout 1999 and a 12% increase in combined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end of 1998 to the end of 1999. SPECIAL CHARGES 2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing functions. 1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in a charge to operations of $21 million. The net restructuring charge of $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects $3 million of excess reserves related to prior restructuring actions. The $21 million cost of these actions was comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center and $10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These restructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999. The charge was comprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to be disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees. EXECUTIVE BONUS During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible. Approximately half of 17 the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Net interest income increased $116 million or 133% to $203 million during 2000 as compared to 1999. This increase is attributable to three principal factors. First, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased $801 million or 25% during 2000. Second, the weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to 6.55% as of the end of 2000 compared to 5.38% at the end of 1999. The combination of these first two factors increased interest income during 2000 by $66 million. Third, interest expense declined $26 million during 2000 as a result of the conversion of approximately $661 million of the Company's convertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of 1999. During 1999, the Company experienced a $59 million increase in net interest income, primarily the result of higher cash and investment balances, and by decreased interest expense associated with the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes during the third quarter of 1999. GAIN FROM SALE OF INVESTMENT The Company holds a significant equity investment in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. As of September 30, 2000, the Company holds 34.8 million shares of ARM stock valued at $383 million. During 2000, the Company sold a total of 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $372 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $367 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $94 million. During 1999, the Company sold a total of 163 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $25 million. During 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of the shares it held in ARM at that time for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 million. The Company also recognized during 1998 other income of approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. Further information related to the Company's investment in ARM and gains recognized related to that investment may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES As of September 30, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $466 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. This asset is generally realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of September 30, 2000, a valuation allowance of $33 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for 2000 was 28% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided. 18 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," was issued. The statement deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as of October 1, 2000. Net of the related income tax effect, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 is expected to have a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million and a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of $15 million. Management does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company will adopt SAB 101 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): 2000 1999 1998 -------- -------- -------- Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.......... $4,027 $3,226 $2,300 Accounts receivable, net.................................... $ 953 $ 681 $ 955 Inventory................................................... $ 33 $ 20 $ 78 Working capital............................................. $3,494 $2,736 $2,178 Days sales in accounts receivable(a)........................ 46 46 56 Days of supply in inventory(b).............................. 2 2 6 Operating cash flow......................................... $ 826 $ 798 $ 775 - ------------------------ (a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. 19 As of September 30, 2000, the Company had $4.027 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $801 million or 25% over the same balances at the end of 1999. During 2000, the Company's primary source of cash was $826 million in cash flows from operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999 include $7 million and $4 million, respectively, pledged primarily as collateral against outstanding derivative positions. In addition to the net purchase of short-term investments of $936 million, net cash used by investing activities consisted primarily of $232 million for the purchase of long-term investments, including $200 million invested in EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink) discussed below, and $107 million for the purchase of fixed assets. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from sales of ARM shares of $372 million. The Company currently expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately $225 million during 2001 to accommodate information systems enhancements and strategic initiatives. In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 2.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $116 million. Since inception of the plan, the Company has repurchased a total of 5.05 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $191 million. The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current non-investment grade debt ratings (Standard and Poor's Rating Agency of BB and Moody's Investor Services of Ba2), if the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can be no assurance such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS The Company holds significant investments in ARM, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Akamai Technologies, Inc., and EarthLink. These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other income. The combined fair value of these investments was $786 million and $339 million as of September 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. COMPETITION The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, 20 continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, and design and publishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, the Company's future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. During 2001, the Company plans to introduce a new client operating system, Mac OS X, which will offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. Inability to successfully introduce Mac OS X on a timely basis, gain customer acceptance, obtain the commitment of developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X, or ensure adequate backward-compatibility of Mac OS X with applications authored for previous version of the Mac OS, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. INVENTORY AND SUPPLY The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 21 The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through purchase orders typically covering the Company's requirements for periods from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. The Company ended 2000 with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through of the Company's products during the fourth quarter. The Company currently anticipates a significant sequential decline in quarterly net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2001, in part due to the Company's plan to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal 2000 to more normal levels by the end of the first quarter. Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries) that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Apple has been unable to ship Macintosh systems with PowerPC G4 22 microprocessors running above 500 megahertz since such systems were first announced in August of 1999 due to its G4 microprocessor supplier's inability to provide the Company with faster G4 microprocessors. Similar but less pronounced supply issues have also arisen with the Company's supply of faster PowerPC G3 microprocessors. The Company believes that this inability to obtain faster microprocessors had an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations during 2000, particularly towards the end of the fiscal year. The Company has been informed by its suppliers that faster microprocessors will be available in sufficient quantity beginning in the first half of calendar 2001. However, no assurance can be given that such faster microprocessors will actually be available or be available in sufficient quantities, and the inability of the Company to obtain faster microprocessors in sufficient quantities during 2001 may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Raw Materials," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9 under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. EDUCATION MARKET Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers. As a result, the Company's overall share of this market has declined. Additionally, net sales in the Company's education market fell short of expectations by approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter of 2000, primarily as a result of the Company's transition to a more direct sales model from a model heavily dependent on third party sales agents. Although the Company has initiated a plan to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain its existing share of that market. Failure to increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets to consumers, certain education customers, and certain resellers either directly or through its on-line stores around the world. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins, and may distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. GLOBAL MARKET RISKS A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. Historically, the Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen 23 and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can effect the cost to the Company of product components, negatively impacting the Company's results of operations. Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS The Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce Mac OS X during 2001 could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current Mac OS, and there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop software for Mac OS X on a timely basis or at all. In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years from August 1997, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has announced its intention to do so, these agreements do not require Microsoft to produce future versions of its products that are optimized to run on Mac OS X. The Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and make that product the default Internet browser for such Mac OS releases. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows platform. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS, including Mac OS X, not covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages. PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because of technological changes 24 in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, no litigation has arisen out of any of these claims that has had, or is expected to have, an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company believes that any necessary patent or other rights could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the Company would prevail in any such challenge. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of such claims, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, AND CHANNEL MIX The Company's profit margins vary among its products, its geographic markets, and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales. INTRA-QUARTER SALES CYCLE Apple generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL Much of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where many of the Company's employees are located. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees. MINORITY INVESTMENTS The Company holds minority investments in several public companies including Samsung Electronics Co., Akamai Technologies, Inc., EarthLink, and ARM Holdings plc. The combined fair market value of these investments was approximately $786 million as of September 30, 2000. The Company has categorized its investments in these companies as available-for-sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility. While the overall financial impact of these investments has been positive through the end of 2000, adverse changes in general market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying companies could result in the Company's inability to ultimately realize the gains associated with the carrying value of these investments. Permanent impairment in the value of one or all of these investments could cause the Company to recognize a loss on some portion of its original $316 million investment remaining in these four companies. EURO TRANSITION On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro is now traded on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. The transition period for introduction of the Euro ends on January 1, 2002. 25 The Company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities, review the ability of financial institution vendors to support Euro transactions, and examine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the Euro conversion. Additionally, the Company has begun the process of updating its internal systems and processes to accommodate full transition to the Euro as the transaction and reporting currency for its affected European subsidiaries. The transition to the Euro may have competitive implications on the Company's pricing and marketing strategies, the impact of which are not known at this time. Additionally, the Company is at risk to the extent its principal European suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the Euro transition. Adoption of the Euro and the costs incurred to prepare for that adoption are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance all issues related to the Euro conversion have been identified or that adoption issues identified will be addressed properly or on a timely basis. Failure to properly identify and address issues associated with adoption of the Euro could have a material adverse affect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock in the future. OTHER FACTORS The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be given such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. ITEM 7A. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the non-hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 as of October 1, 2000. Management does not believe that adoption of the new accounting standard will 26 significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. INTEREST RATE RISK While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments. As of September 30, 2000, substantially all of the Company's investments have maturities less than 12 months. During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. The following table presents the principal (or notional) amounts and related weighted-average interest rates for the Company's investment portfolio and its long-term debt obligations. The long-term debt is comprised of $300 million of unsecured notes described above, which mature in February 2004. The Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments have generally 27 been held until maturity. Gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999. In millions, except weighted-average interest rates SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 -------------------- -------------------- WEIGHTED- WEIGHTED- AVERAGE AVERAGE CARRYING INTEREST CARRYING INTEREST AMOUNT RATE AMOUNT RATE -------- --------- -------- --------- Assets: Cash equivalents: U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................ $ -- --% $ 3 5.00% U.S. corporate securities.......................... 921 6.46% 517 5.16% Foreign securities................................. 222 6.05% 636 4.84% ------ ------ Total cash equivalents........................... 1,143 6.38% 1,156 4.98% ------ ------ Short-term investments: U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................ $ 293 6.11% $ 298 5.56% U.S. corporate securities.......................... 2,059 6.63% 780 5.89% Foreign securities................................. 484 6.86% 822 5.40% ------ ------ Total short-term investments..................... 2,836 6.62% 1,900 5.63% ------ ------ Total investment securities.......................... $3,979 6.55% $3,056 5.38% ====== ====== Debt: Fixed rate........................................... $ 300 5.97% $ 300 5.98% ====== ====== During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. The interest rate swaps, which qualify as accounting hedges, generally require the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively convert the Company's fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and convert a portion of the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The maturity date of the asset swaps is September 2001 with the remaining debt swaps maturing in February of 2004. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, interest rate debt swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 7.21% and 6.04%, respectively. The weighted-average pay rate on the debt swaps was 6.68% and 5.45% as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, respectively. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, interest rate asset swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.50% and 5.53%, respectively; and a weighted-average pay rates of 6.66% and 5.24%, respectively. The unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $1 million as of September 30, 2000 and $5 million as of September 25, 1999. 28 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and availability of appropriate hedging instruments. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current assets and liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings. Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the Company's products and purchases of raw material, sub-assemblies, and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency. A majority of these transactions are made through the Company's subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The Company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts. The term of the Company's foreign exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions, probable but not firmly committed transactions, or to partially finance the foreign risk management program, currently does not extend beyond six months. Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders' equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. Sold interest rate and foreign exchange instruments do not qualify as accounting hedges. Premiums associated with sold foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the option. The following table provides information about the Company's foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999. The information is provided in U.S. dollar amounts, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. For foreign currency exchange contracts, the table presents the notional amount (at contract exchange rates) and the 29 weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, all instruments mature within 6 months. Miscellaneous other currencies consist primarily of the Canadian and Australian dollars. 2000 1999 ----------------------------- ----------------------------- WEIGHTED-AVERAGE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NOTIONAL CONTRACT RATE OR NOTIONAL CONTRACT RATE OR AMOUNT STRIKE PRICE AMOUNT STRIKE PRICE --------- ----------------- --------- ----------------- In millions, except average contract rates and strike prices Foreign currency spot/forward contracts: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 607 105.61 $ 590 105.70 British Pound Sterling.................... 115 1.47 86 1.62 Euro...................................... 313 .89 177 1.05 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 66 62 ------ ------ Total currency spot/forward contracts....... $1,101 $ 915 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ 9 $ (9) ====== ====== Foreign currency purchased call options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 335 95.55 $ 250 104.80 British Pound Sterling.................... -- -- -- Euro...................................... 375 1.00 105 1.14 Miscellaneous other currencies............ -- 55 ------ ------ Total purchased call options............ $ 710 $ 410 ------ ------ Foreign currency purchased put options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 465 107.28 $ 860 118.31 British Pound Sterling.................... 90 1.49 75 1.59 Euro...................................... 326 .92 505 1.00 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 75 100 ------ ------ Total purchased put options............. $ 956 $1,540 ------ ------ Total foreign currency purchased options.... $1,666 $1,950 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ 25 $ 12 ====== ====== Foreign currency sold call options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 365 98.78 $ 290 106.18 British Pound Sterling.................... 90 1.55 25 1.69 Euro...................................... 350 .98 120 1.09 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 45 50 ------ ------ Total sold call options................. $ 850 $ 485 ------ ------ Foreign currency sold put options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 280 107.11 -- -- British Pound Sterling.................... 20 1.44 -- -- Euro...................................... 51 .85 75 1.00 Miscellaneous other currencies............ -- 25 ------ ------ Total sold put options.................. $ 351 100 ------ ------ Total foreign currency sold options......... $1,201 $ 585 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ (5) $ (17) ====== ====== 30 ITEM 8.

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Computer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company amended its by-laws to provide that beginning in 1999 its fiscal year would end on the last Saturday in September rather than the last Friday. Likewise, beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 1999 each of the Company's fiscal quarters now also end on Saturday rather than Friday. Accordingly, one day was added to the first quarter of 1999 so that the quarter ended on Saturday, December 26, 1998. These changes did not have a material effect on the Company's revenue or results of operations for any quarter during fiscal 1999. Fiscal years 1999 and 1998, each 52-week years, both ended on September 25th. Approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. Consequently, an additional week was added to the first quarter of fiscal 2000. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments. INVESTMENTS All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than twelve months are classified as long-term assets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. These unrealized gains or losses include any unrealized losses and gains on interest rate contracts accounted for as hedges against the available-for-sale securities. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and liability management, the Company enters into various types of transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These instruments are entered into in order to manage financial market risk, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into these financial instruments with major international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter as opposed to exchange traded instruments. The Company does not hold or transact in financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. 37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) The Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. Generally, the Company's practice is to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and availability of appropriate hedging instruments. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current assets and liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the option. Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the Company's products and purchases of raw material, subassemblies, and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency. A majority of these transactions are made through the Company's subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The Company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts. The term of the Company's foreign exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions, probable but not firmly committed transactions, or to partially finance the foreign exchange risk management program currently does not extend beyond six months. In addition, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany loan transactions. These forward contracts effectively change certain foreign currency denominated debt into U.S. dollar denominated debt, which better matches against the Company's U.S. dollar denominated cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest rate and foreign exchange instruments generally qualify as accounting hedges if their maturity dates are the same as the hedged transactions and if the hedged transactions meet certain requirements. The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions on a regular basis based on applicable and commonly used pricing models. The correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically over the life of the hedged instrument. In the event it is determined a hedge is ineffective, including if and when the hedged transactions no longer exist, the Company recognizes in income the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an effective hedge. Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders' equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. Sold interest rate and foreign exchange instruments do not qualify as accounting hedges. Premiums associated with sold foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings. In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" was issued. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," was issued. The statement deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until the first quarter of 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as of October 1, 2000. Net of the related income tax effect, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 is expected to have a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million and a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to other comprehensive income of $15 million. Management does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging strategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income and expense and other comprehensive income. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE Software acquired or developed for internal use is stated at cost and classified on the balance sheet in other assets. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis using an estimated useful life of no more than 5 years. During fiscal year 2000, the Company adopted the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires the capitalization of certain internal costs incurred in the acquisition or development of internal-use software. The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position during 2000. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, the net carrying amount of software was $106 million and $44 million, respectively. 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount, including the unamortized portion of any allocated goodwill, to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets, including any allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair market value. The recoverability of enterprise level goodwill is assessed whenever the facts and circumstances suggest the asset may be impaired. The Company assesses the recoverability of enterprise level goodwill by determining whether the unamortized goodwill balance can be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. For the three years ended September 30, 2000, the Company has made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 4. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign sales subsidiaries at year-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to "accumulated translation adjustment" included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other entities use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations are included in the Company's results of operations and were not significant in 2000, 1999 or 1998. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met at the time product is shipped. Provisions are made currently for estimated product returns, price protection, rebates, and other sales programs. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company will adopt SAB 101 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. WARRANTY EXPENSE The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under product warranties when products are shipped. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs are charged to expense the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was $281 million, $208 million, and $152 million for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. 40 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for release to customers. Generally, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. As a result, costs subsequent to achieving technological feasibility have not been significant and all software development costs have been expensed. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method and has provided in Note 8 pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method. STOCK SPLIT On June 21, 2000, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a Common Stock dividend to shareholders of record as of May 19, 2000. All per share data and numbers of Common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale. See Note 2 for additional information regarding available-for-sale securities. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company reports segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. Information about the Company's products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed. 41 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVESTMENTS The following table summarizes the Company's available-for-sale securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999 (in millions): SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 AMORTIZED COST AMORTIZED COST ------------------ ------------------ U.S. Treasury securities.................... $ -- $ 3 U.S. corporate securities................... 921 517 Foreign securities.......................... 222 636 ------ ------ Total included in cash and cash equivalents............................. 1,143 1,156 U.S. Treasury securities.................... 293 298 U.S. corporate securities................... 2,059 780 Foreign securities.......................... 484 822 ------ ------ Total included in short-term investments............................. 2,836 1,900 ------ ------ Total..................................... $3,979 $3,056 ====== ====== As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, substantially all of the Company's investments had maturities less than twelve months. The Company's U.S. corporate securities include U.S. Government Agency notes, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participations, time deposits and certificates of deposit with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments are generally held until maturity. Gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999 include $7 million and $4 million, respectively, pledged primarily as collateral against outstanding derivative positions. TRADE RECEIVABLES The Company distributes its products principally through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education and consumer customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America and Asia. However, considerable trade receivables which are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 42 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS The following table shows the notional principal, net fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and foreign currency instruments as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999 (in millions). SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------- NOTIONAL FAIR CREDIT RISK NOTIONAL FAIR CREDIT RISK PRINCIPAL VALUE AMOUNTS PRINCIPAL VALUE AMOUNTS --------- --------- ----------- --------- -------- ----------- Transactions qualifying as accounting hedges: Interest rate instruments: Swaps....................................... $ 800 $ (1) $ 4 $ 790 $ (5) $ -- Foreign exchange instruments: Spot/Forward contracts, net................. $ 826 $ 10 $ 10 $ 730 $ (8) $ 4 Purchased options, net...................... $ 615 $ 21 $ -- $1,305 $ 4 $ -- Transactions other than accounting hedges: Foreign exchange instruments: Spot/Forward contracts, net................. $ 275 $ -- $ -- $ 185 $ (1) $ -- Purchased options, net...................... $1,051 $ 4 $ 4 $ 645 $ 8 $ 8 Sold options, net........................... $1,201 $ (5) $ -- $ 585 $(17) $ -- The notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the interest rate and foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The interest rate swaps, which qualify as accounting hedges, generally require the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively convert the Company's fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and convert the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The maturity date of the asset swaps is September 2001 and the debt swaps mature in February of 2004. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, interest rate debt swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 7.21% and 6.04%, respectively. The weighted-average pay rate on the debt swaps was 6.68% and 5.45% as of September 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, interest rate asset swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.50% and 5.53% respectively; and a weighted-average pay rate of 6.66% and 5.24%, respectively. The unrealized gains and 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $1 million as of September 30, 2000 and $5 million as of September 25, 1999. The foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as hedges are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. The foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges are also carried at fair value in other current assets and liabilities with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. As of September 30, 2000, maturity dates for foreign exchange forward contracts held by the Company ranged from one to five months. If the option contract is designated and effective as a hedge of a firmly committed transaction, or a probable but not firmly committed transaction, then any gain or loss is deferred until the occurrence of the hedged transaction. Deferred gains and losses on such contracts were not significant as of September 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999. If the option contract is used to hedge an asset or liability, then the option is carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses and gains on the hedged transaction. As of September 30, 2000, maturity dates for purchased foreign exchange option contracts and sold option contracts ranged from one to five months. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company's investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions. To date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company. The Company does not believe there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the financial exposure and the number of agreements and contracts it enters into with any one party. The Company generally does not require collateral from counterparties, except for margin agreements associated with the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company's ten-year unsecured notes. To mitigate the credit risk associated with these ten-year swap transactions, which mature in 2004, the Company entered into margining agreements with its third-party bank counterparties. These agreements require the Company or the counterparty to post margin only if certain credit risk thresholds are exceeded. The amounts held in margin accounts were not significant as of September 30, 2000. LONG-TERM DEBT UNSECURED NOTES During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, the carrying amount of these notes was $300 million, while the fair value was $279 million and $280 million, respectively. The fair value of the notes is based on their listed market values as of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999. CONVERTIBLE NOTES During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the Notes) to certain qualified parties in a private placement. The Notes were sold at 100% of par, paid interest semiannually, and matured on June 1, 2001 if not converted earlier. The Notes 44 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) were convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996, at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. No Notes had been converted as of September 25, 1998. The Notes were redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve month period beginning June 1, 2000. On April 14, 1999, the Company called for redemption of the Notes. Not including approximately $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, debentures in an aggregate principal amount outstanding totaled approximately $661 million as of March 27, 1999. During the third quarter of 1999, debenture holders chose to convert virtually all of the outstanding debentures to common stock at a rate of $29.205 per share resulting in the issuance of approximately 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock. NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED GAINS The Company holds significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other income. The combined fair value of these investments was $786 million and $339 million as of September 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future. ARM HOLDINGS ARM is a publicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing of high performance microprocessors and related technology. As of September 25, 1999, the Company held approximately 80 million shares of ARM stock with a fair value of $226 million. Share data for ARM presented in this Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect ARM's four-for-one stock split in April of 1999 and its five-for-one stock split in April of 2000. During 2000, the Company sold a total of approximately 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $372 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $367 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $94 million. As of September 30, 2000, the Company holds 34.8 million shares of ARM stock valued at $383 million. During 1999, the Company sold a total of approximately 163 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $25 million. As of September 25, 1999, the Company held 80 million shares of ARM stock valued at $226 million. As of September 26, 1997, the Company owned 42.3% of the outstanding stock of ARM. The Company had accounted for this investment using the equity method through September 25, 1998. On April 17, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 million. Foreign tax recognized on this gain was approximately $7 million. At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method requires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the Company also 45 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As of September 25, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM carried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately $22 million. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 58 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock. As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19.7%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as available-for-sale. EARTHLINK In January 2000, the Company invested $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet service provider (ISP). The investment is in EarthLink's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which is convertible by the Company after January 4, 2001, into approximately 7.1 million shares of EarthLink common stock. Concurrent with this investment, EarthLink and the Company entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP service to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company profits from each new Mac customer that subscribes to EarthLink's ISP service for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the default ISP in Apple's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United States. The fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink is approximately $64 million as of September 30, 2000. SAMSUNG During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in July 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. The fair value of the Company's investment in Samsung is approximately $123 million as of September 30, 2000. AKAMAI In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai, a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai is approximately $216 million as of September 30, 2000. 46 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 3--CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT DETAILS (IN MILLIONS) INVENTORIES 2000 1999 -------- -------- Purchased parts............................................. $ 1 $ 4 Work in process............................................. 2 3 Finished goods.............................................. 30 13 --- --- Total inventories........................................... $33 $20 === === PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT 2000 1999 -------- -------- Land and buildings.......................................... $ 324 $ 323 Machinery and equipment..................................... 185 220 Office furniture and equipment.............................. 60 61 Leasehold improvements...................................... 131 125 ----- ----- 700 729 Accumulated depreciation and amortization...................

The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were essentially complete at the end of 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time employees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not critical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $297 million and noncash asset write-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through September 30, 2000. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of $396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the fourth quarter of 1999 and was reversed. The Company expects the remaining accrual for payments on canceled facility leases will result in cash expenditures of approximately $1 million in 2001. The following table depicts the restructuring activity through September 30, 2000, associated with the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions described above (in millions): PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES PAYMENTS ON WRITE-DOWN OF PAYMENTS ON INVOLUNTARILY CANCELED FACILITY OPERATING ASSETS CANCELED TERMINATED (A) LEASES (A) TO BE SOLD (B) CONTRACTS (A) TOTAL -------------- ----------------- ---------------- ------------- -------- Balances as of September 26, 1997......................... $ 76 $ 25 $ 39 $ 40 $ 180 Adjustments during 1998........ 6 4 3 (13) -- Spending during 1998...........

The net restructuring charge of $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter 48 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 4--SPECIAL CHARGES (CONTINUED) of 1999 reflects $3 million of excess reserves related to prior restructuring actions. The $21 million cost of these actions was comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center, substantially all of which had been spent by the end of the third quarter of 2000, and $10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued, substantially all of which had been utilized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2000. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These restructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999. The charge was comprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to be disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees and were substantially completed as of September 25, 1999. 2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS During the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent by September 30, 2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following two quarters. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized by the end of the second quarter of 2000. EXECUTIVE BONUS During the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. This executive bonus has been presented outside selling, general, and administrative expenses as a special charge. TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of purchased in-process research and development, which was charged to operations upon acquisition. 49 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions): 2000 1999 1998 -------- -------- -------- Federal: Current................................................. $ 9 $ 4 $-- Deferred................................................ 239 30 -- ---- --- --- 248 34 -- ---- --- --- State: Current................................................. -- -- -- Deferred................................................ 23 11 -- ---- --- --- 23 11 -- ---- --- --- Foreign: Current................................................. 37 33 11 Deferred................................................ (2) (3) 9 ---- --- --- 35 30 20 ---- --- --- Provision for income taxes................................ $306 $75 $20 ==== === === The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of approximately $1,019 million, $612 million, and $315 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. A substantial portion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $755 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 50 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) As of September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 2000 1999 -------- -------- Deferred tax assets: Accounts receivable and inventory reserves................ $ 24 $ 31 Accrued liabilities and other reserves.................... 97 77 Basis of capital assets and investments................... 65 67 Tax losses and credits.................................... 280 438 ----- ---- Total deferred tax assets................................. 466 613 Less valuation allowance.................................... 33 60 ----- ---- Net deferred tax assets..................................... 433 553 ----- ---- Deferred tax liabilities: Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries....................... 480 442 Available-for-sale securities............................. 174 84 Other..................................................... 19 12 ----- ---- Total deferred tax liabilities............................ 673 538 ----- ---- Net deferred tax asset (liability).......................... $(240) $ 15 ===== ==== As of September 30, 2000, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $54 million, which expire in 2012. This does not include approximately $79 million of remaining operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT, which expire in 2009 - 2012, and the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has Federal credit carryforwards and various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $129 million and which expire between 2001 and 2015. The remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 30, 2000, a valuation allowance of $33 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT. The net change in the total valuation allowance in 2000 was a decrease of $27 million. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2000, 1999, and 1998) to income before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions): 2000 1999 1998 -------- -------- -------- Computed expected tax.................................. $382 $236 $115 State taxes, net of federal effect..................... 15 12 10 Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries.........................................

The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. NOTE 6--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a total of 2.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $116 million. Since inception of the plan, the Company has repurchased a total of 5.05 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $191 million. PREFERRED STOCK In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. Upon any sale of the preferred stock by Microsoft, the shares will automatically be converted into shares of Apple common stock at a conversion price of $16.50 per share, and the shares can be converted at Microsoft's option at such price after August 5, 2000. Each share of preferred stock is entitled to receive, if and when declared by the Company's Board of Directors, a dividend of $30.00 per share per annum, payable in preference to any dividend on the Company's common stock. Additionally, if the dividends per share paid on the common stock are greater than the dividends per share paid on the preferred stock on an "as if converted" basis, then the Board of Directors shall declare an additional dividend such that the dividends per share paid on the preferred stock on an "as if converted" basis, shall equal the dividends per share paid on the common stock. On September 15, 2000, approximately 74,000 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares of the Company's common stock. 52 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 7--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN The Company has in effect a 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan), which replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these plans' termination dates remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, executive officers of the Company at the level of Senior Vice President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. A total of 38,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1998 Plan, of which 7,181,104 shares are reserved for future issuance as of September 30, 2000. 1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. A total of 43,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1997 Plan, of which 3,929,356 shares are reserved for future issuance as of September 30, 2000. 1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP), for which directors of the Company are eligible. Options granted under the DSOP vest in three equal installments, on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant. A total of 800,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the DSOP, of which 420,000 shares remain reserved for future issuance. Supplementally and separate from the DSOP, 60,000 options had been granted in total to two members of the Company's Board of Directors, of which 30,000 shares remain outstanding as of September 30, 2000. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of the six-month offering period. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 2000, 1999, and 1998, 766,000, 1.1 million and 2.2 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 30, 2000, approximately 5.76 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($10,500 for calendar year 2000). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 7--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED) matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $16 million, $13 million, and $14 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. STOCK OPTION ACTIVITY A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the years ended September 30, 2000 and September 25, 1999 and 1998, follows (option amounts are presented in thousands): YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- NUMBER WEIGHTED- NUMBER WEIGHTED- NUMBER WEIGHTED- OF AVERAGE OF AVERAGE OF AVERAGE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE -------- -------------- -------- -------------- -------- -------------- Options outstanding--beginning of year............................... 36,808 $13.20 37,388 $10.24 37,298 $ 8.62 Granted............................ 45,662 $46.52 11,910 $19.44 27,758 $11.56 Exercised..........................

NOTE 8--STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 54 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 8--STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED) Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 1998 includes the excess value of the repriced options granted during the fiscal year less the value of the related forfeited options on the date the repriced options were granted. The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows: 2000 1999 1998 --------- --------- --------- Expected life of options.................... 4 years 4 years 3.5 years Expected life of stock purchases............ 6 months 6 months 6 months Interest rate--stock options................ 6.20% 5.02% 5.54% Interest rate--stock purchases.............. 6.21% 4.89% 5.37% Volatility--stock options................... 67% 55% 78% Volatility--stock purchases................. 60% 59% 56% Dividend yields............................. -- -- -- Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year................... $ 25.92 $ 9.61 $ 6.49 The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are amortized to pro forma net income over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2000 1999 1998 -------- -------- -------- Net income--as reported................................ $ 786 $ 601 $ 309 Net income--pro forma.................................. $ 483 $ 528 $ 266 Net income per common share--as reported Basic................................................ $2.42 $2.10 $1.17 Diluted.............................................. $2.18 $1.81 $1.05 Net income per common share--pro forma Basic................................................ $1.49 $1.84 $1.01 Diluted.............................................. $1.38 $1.61 $0.93 As SFAS No. 123 is applicable only to options granted or shares issued subsequent to September 29, 1995, its pro forma effect was not fully reflected until 1999. 55 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 9--COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases various facilities, equipment, and data transmission capacity under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The major facilities leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 3 to 5 additional years. Rent expense under all operating leases was approximately $93 million, $61 million, and $63 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2000, are as follows (in millions): FISCAL YEARS - ------------ 2001........................................................ $ 61 2002........................................................ 55 2003........................................................ 40 2004........................................................ 30 2005........................................................ 18 Later years................................................. 51 ---- Total minimum lease payments................................ $255 ==== CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers.If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. LITIGATION The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal proceedings and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 56 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 9--COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Mr. Jerome York, a member of the Board of the Directors of the Company, is a member of an investment group that purchased MicroWarehouse, Inc. (MICROWAREHOUSE) in January 2000. He also serves as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. MicroWarehouse is a multi-billion dollar specialty catalog and online retailer and direct marketer of computer products, including products made by the Company, through its MacWarehouse catalogue. During fiscal year 2000, MicroWarehouse accounted for 3.26% of the Company's net sales. NOTE 10--SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. Other operating segments include Asia-Pacific, which includes Australia and Asia except for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary, Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products and services, and the accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Operating income for each segment includes revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Net sales are based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed outside the reportable segment. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, income taxes, and nonrecurring charges for purchased in-process research and development, restructuring, and acquisition related costs. Corporate expenses include research and development, manufacturing expenses not included in segment cost of sales, corporate marketing expenses, and other separately managed general and administrative expenses.
