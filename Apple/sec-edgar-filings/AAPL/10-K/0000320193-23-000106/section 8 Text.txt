Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.General RisksThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C. CybersecurityNot applicable.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16Item 2. PropertiesThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsEpic GamesEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.MasimoMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.Other Legal ProceedingsThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.Item 4.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.(2)In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18Company Stock PerformanceThe following graph shows a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis, for the Company, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.Fiscal PeriodThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each.Fiscal Year HighlightsThe Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:First Quarter 2023:•iPad and iPad Pro;•Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and•MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.Second Quarter 2023:•MacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and•Second-generation HomePod.Third Quarter 2023:•MacBook Air 15”, Mac Studio and Mac Pro;•Apple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and•iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s operating systems.Fourth Quarter 2023:•iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and•Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.In May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):2023Change2022Change2021Research and development$29,915 14 %$26,251 20 %$21,914 Percentage

%13.3 %Statutory federal income tax rate21 %21 %21 %The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:DebtAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.Other Purchase ObligationsThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.Deemed Repatriation Tax PayableAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24Capital Return ProgramIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate RiskThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):Interest RateSensitive InstrumentHypothetical InterestRate IncreasePotential Impact20232022Investment portfolio100 basis points, all tenorsDecline in fair value$3,089 $4,022 Term debt100 basis points, all tenorsIncrease in annual interest expense$194 $201 Foreign Exchange Rate RiskThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.The Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26Item 8.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.RevenueThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.Share-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.Marketable SecuritiesThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33Note 2 – RevenueThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):202320222021iPhone (1)$200,583 $205,489 $191,973 Mac (1)29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad (1)28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)39,845 41,241 38,367 Services (2)85,200 78,129 68,425 Total net sales$383,285 $394,328 $365,817 (1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.(2)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.Note 3 – Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):202320222021Numerator:Net income$96,995 $99,803 $94,680 Denominator:Weighted-average basic shares outstanding15,744,231 16,215,963 16,701,272 Effect of dilutive share-based awards68,316 109,856 163,647 Weighted-average diluted shares15,812,547 16,325,819 16,864,919 Basic earnings per share$6.16 $6.15 $5.67 Diluted earnings per share$6.13 $6.11 $5.61 Approximately 24 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 35Note 4 – Financial InstrumentsCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):2023AdjustedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueCash andCashEquivalentsCurrentMarketableSecuritiesNon-CurrentMarketableSecuritiesCash$28,359 $— $— $28,359 $28,359 $— $— Level 1:Money market funds481 — — 481 481 — — Mutual funds and equity securities442 12 (26)428 — 428 — Subtotal923 12 (26)909 481 428 — Level 2 (1):U.S. Treasury securities19,406 — (1,292)18,114 35 5,468 12,611 U.S. agency securities5,736 — (600)5,136 36 271 4,829 Non-U.S. government securities17,533 6 (1,048)16,491 — 11,332 5,159 Certificates of deposit and time deposits1,354 — — 1,354 1,034 320 — Commercial paper608 — — 608 — 608 — Corporate debt securities76,840 6 (5,956)70,890 20 12,627 58,243 Municipal securities628 — (26)602 — 192 410 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities22,365 6 (2,735)19,636 — 344 19,292 Subtotal144,470 18 (11,657)132,831 1,125 31,162 100,544 Total (2)$173,752 $30 $(11,683)$162,099 $29,965 $31,590 $100,544 2022AdjustedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueCash andCashEquivalentsCurrentMarketableSecuritiesNon-CurrentMarketableSecuritiesCash$18,546 $— $— $18,546 $18,546 $— $— Level 1:Money market funds2,929 — — 2,929 2,929 — — Mutual funds274 — (47)227 — 227 — Subtotal3,203 — (47)3,156 2,929 227 — Level 2 (1):U.S. Treasury securities25,134 — (1,725)23,409 338 5,091 17,980 U.S. agency securities5,823 — (655)5,168 — 240 4,928 Non-U.S. government securities16,948 2 (1,201)15,749 — 8,806 6,943 Certificates of deposit and time deposits2,067 — — 2,067 1,805 262 — Commercial paper718 — — 718 28 690 — Corporate debt securities87,148 9 (7,707)79,450 — 9,023 70,427 Municipal securities921 — (35)886 — 266 620 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities22,553 — (2,593)19,960 — 53 19,907 Subtotal161,312 11 (13,916)147,407 2,171 24,431 120,805 Total (2)$183,061 $11 $(13,963)$169,109 $23,646 $24,658 $120,805 (1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.(2)As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.8 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2023 (in millions):Due after 1 year through 5 years$74,427 Due after 5 years through 10 years9,964 Due after 10 years16,153 Total fair value$100,544 The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.Foreign Exchange Rate RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):20232022Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$74,730 $102,670 Interest rate contracts$19,375 $20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$104,777 $185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):2022Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting HedgesFair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting HedgesTotalFair ValueDerivative assets (1):Foreign exchange contracts$4,317 $2,819 $7,136 Derivative liabilities (2):Foreign exchange contracts$2,205 $2,547 $4,752 Interest rate contracts$1,367 $— $1,367 (1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):20232022Hedged assets/(liabilities):Current and non-current marketable securities$14,433 $13,378 Current and non-current term debt$(18,247)$(18,739)Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 38Note 5 – Property, Plant and EquipmentThe following table shows the Company’s gross property, plant and equipment by major asset class and accumulated depreciation as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):20232022Land and buildings$23,446 $22,126 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software78,314 81,060 Leasehold improvements12,839 11,271 Gross property, plant and equipment114,599 114,457 Accumulated depreciation(70,884)(72,340)Total property, plant and equipment, net$43,715 $42,117 Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.5 billion, $8.7 billion and $9.5 billion during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Note 6 – Consolidated Financial Statement DetailsThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):Other Non-Current Assets20232022Deferred tax assets$17,852 $15,375 Other non-current assets46,906 39,053 Total other non-current assets$64,758 $54,428 Other Current Liabilities20232022Income taxes payable$8,819 $6,552 Other current liabilities50,010 54,293 Total other current liabilities$58,829 $60,845 Other Non-Current Liabilities20232022Long-term taxes payable$15,457 $16,657 Other non-current liabilities34,391 32,485 Total other non-current liabilities$49,848 $49,142 Other Income/(Expense), NetThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):202320222021Interest and dividend income$3,750 $2,825 $2,843 Interest expense(3,933)(2,931)(2,645)Other income/(expense), net(382)(228)60 Total other income/(expense), net$(565)$(334)$258 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 39Note 7 – Income TaxesProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax RateThe provision for income taxes for 2023, 2022 and 2021, consisted of the following (in millions):202320222021Federal:Current$9,445 $7,890 $8,257 Deferred(3,644)(2,265)(7,176)Total5,801 5,625 1,081 State:Current1,570 1,519 1,620 Deferred(49)84 (338)Total1,521 1,603 1,282 Foreign:Current8,750 8,996 9,424 Deferred669 3,076 2,740 Total9,419 12,072 12,164 Provision for income taxes$16,741 $19,300 $14,527 The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $72.9 billion, $71.3 billion and $68.7 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2023, 2022 and 2021) to income before provision for income taxes for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (dollars in millions):202320222021Computed expected tax$23,885 $25,012 $22,933 State taxes, net of federal effect1,124 1,518 1,151 Earnings of foreign subsidiaries(5,744)(4,366)(4,715)Research and development credit, net(1,212)(1,153)(1,033)Excess tax benefits from equity awards(1,120)(1,871)(2,137)Foreign-derived intangible income deduction— (296)(1,372)Other(192)456 (300)Provision for income taxes$16,741 $19,300 $14,527 Effective tax rate14.7 %16.2 %13.3 %Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 40Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesAs of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):20232022Deferred tax assets:Tax credit carryforwards$8,302 $6,962 Accrued liabilities and other reserves6,365 6,515 Capitalized research and development6,294 1,267 Deferred revenue4,571 5,742 Unrealized losses2,447 2,913 Lease liabilities2,421 2,400 Other2,343 3,407 Total deferred tax assets32,743 29,206 Less: Valuation allowance(8,374)(7,530)Total deferred tax assets, net24,369 21,676 Deferred tax liabilities:Right-of-use assets2,179 2,163 Depreciation1,998 1,582 Minimum tax on foreign earnings1,940 1,983 Unrealized gains511 942 Other490 469 Total deferred tax liabilities7,118 7,139 Net deferred tax assets$17,251 $14,537 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $5.2 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.0 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in millions):202320222021Beginning balances$16,758 $15,477 $16,475 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year2,044 2,284 816 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year(1,463)(1,982)(1,402)Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year2,628 1,936 1,607 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities(19)(28)(1,838)Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations(494)(929)(181)Ending balances$19,454 $16,758 $15,477 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.5 billion.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41European Commission State Aid DecisionOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.Note 8 – LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $13.9 billion, $14.9 billion and $12.9 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The Company made $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):Lease-Related Assets and LiabilitiesFinancial Statement Line Items20232022Right-of-use assets:Operating leasesOther non-current assets$10,661 $10,417 Finance leasesProperty, plant and equipment, net1,015 952 Total right-of-use assets$11,676 $11,369 Lease liabilities:Operating leasesOther current liabilities$1,410 $1,534 Other non-current liabilities10,408 9,936 Finance leasesOther current liabilities165 129 Other non-current liabilities859 812 Total lease liabilities$12,842 $12,411 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 42Lease liability maturities as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):OperatingLeasesFinanceLeasesTotal2024$1,719 $196 $1,915 20251,875 151 2,026 20261,732 120 1,852 20271,351 52 1,403 20281,181 34 1,215 Thereafter5,983 872 6,855 Total undiscounted liabilities13,841 1,425 15,266 Less: Imputed interest(2,023)(401)(2,424)Total lease liabilities$11,818 $1,024 $12,842 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 10.6 years and 10.1 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 was 3.0% and 2.3%, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $544 million of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 21 years.Note 9 – DebtCommercial PaperThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $6.0 billion and $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.2014 Employee Stock PlanThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.Restricted Stock UnitsA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows:Number ofRSUs(in thousands)Weighted-AverageGrant Date FairValue Per RSUAggregateFair Value(in millions)Balance as of September 26, 2020310,778 $51.58 RSUs granted89,363 $116.33 RSUs vested(145,766)$50.71 RSUs canceled(13,948)$68.95 Balance as of September 25, 2021240,427 $75.16 RSUs granted91,674 $150.70 RSUs vested(115,861)$72.12 RSUs canceled(14,739)$99.77 Balance as of September 24, 2022201,501 $109.48 RSUs granted88,768 $150.87 RSUs vested(101,878)$97.31 RSUs canceled(8,144)$127.98 Balance as of September 30, 2023180,247 $135.91 $30,860 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.9 billion, $18.2 billion and $19.0 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $5.6 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 45Share-Based CompensationThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):202320222021Share-based compensation expense$10,833 $9,038 $7,906 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense$(3,421)$(4,002)$(4,056)As of September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $18.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.Note 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply ConcentrationsUnconditional Purchase ObligationsThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions):2024$4,258 20252,674 20263,434 20271,277 20285,878 Thereafter3,215 Total$20,736 ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):202320222021Americas:Net sales$162,560 $169,658 $153,306 Operating income$60,508 $62,683 $53,382 Europe:Net sales$94,294 $95,118 $89,307 Operating income$36,098 $35,233 $32,505 Greater China:Net sales$72,559 $74,200 $68,366 Operating income$30,328 $31,153 $28,504 Japan:Net sales$24,257 $25,977 $28,482 Operating income$11,888 $12,257 $12,798 Rest of Asia Pacific:Net sales$29,615 $29,375 $26,356 Operating income$12,066 $11,569 $9,817 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):202320222021Segment operating income$150,888 $152,895 $137,006 Research and development expense(29,915)(26,251)(21,914)Other corporate expenses, net (1)(6,672)(7,207)(6,143)Total operating income$114,301 $119,437 $108,949 (1)Includes corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 47The U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.Uncertain Tax PositionsDescription of the MatterAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49How We Addressed theMatter in Our AuditWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.San Jose, CaliforniaNovember 2, 2023Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 2, 2023Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51
