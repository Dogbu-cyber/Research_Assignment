Net Income: $424
Operating Income: $684

Summary: Based on the financial information provided in the report, Apple Computer, Inc. appears to be in a relatively strong financial position overall.

The company reported net income of $424 million and operating income of $684 million for the fiscal year 1995. This represents a significant increase from the prior year, with net income growing by 37% and operating income increasing by 31%. This growth in profitability can be attributed to a 20% increase in net sales, driven by strong demand for the company's newer product offerings, particularly the Power Macintosh line.

Gross margin also improved, increasing from 25.5% in 1994 to 25.8% in 1995, indicating that the company was able to maintain pricing power and control costs effectively. The company's balance sheet appears healthy, with a cash and short-term investment balance of $952 million and manageable levels of short-term and long-term debt.

However, the report also notes that the company faces significant competitive pressures and challenges, including ongoing pricing pressures, the need to effectively manage product transitions, and the potential impact of global market risks such as currency fluctuations. Additionally, the company's gross margins declined in the fourth quarter of 1995, suggesting that these competitive pressures may be intensifying.

Overall, the financial data suggests that Apple Computer is in a relatively strong position, with solid profitability, a healthy balance sheet, and the ability to generate significant cash flow. However, the company will need to continue to execute effectively and manage the various risks and challenges it faces in order to maintain and build upon its current financial performance.
