Net Income: $65 million
Operating Income: $17 million

Summary: Based on the financial information provided in the report, Apple's overall financial health appears to be stable, but with some areas of concern.

The company reported net income of $65 million for the fiscal year, indicating profitability. However, the operating income of $17 million is significantly lower, suggesting that the company's core operations are not as strong as the net income figure might suggest.

The report also highlights several non-recurring items that impacted the company's financial performance, including restructuring charges, in-process research and development charges, and gains/losses on investments. These non-recurring items make it difficult to assess the underlying strength of the company's operations.

Additionally, the company's gross margin declined from 27% in fiscal year 2000 to 23% in fiscal year 2001, before recovering to 28% in fiscal year 2002. This suggests that the company is facing pricing pressures and challenges in maintaining profitability, which could be a concern going forward.

The company's cash and short-term investments position of $4.337 billion is strong, providing a solid financial cushion. However, the report also highlights significant lease commitments and potential liabilities related to environmental regulations, which could put pressure on the company's financial resources.

Overall, while Apple appears to be profitable and has a strong cash position, the report suggests that the company is facing operational challenges and may need to closely manage its costs and investments to maintain its financial health in the long term.
