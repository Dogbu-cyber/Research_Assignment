Net Income: $69 million
Operating Income: -$1 million

Summary: Based on the financial information provided in the report, Apple Computer, Inc. appears to be in a relatively healthy financial position, though there are some areas of concern.

The company reported net income of $69 million for the fiscal year, indicating it was profitable overall. However, the operating income was a loss of $1 million, suggesting the company's core operations were not generating sufficient profits to cover its expenses.

The company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $4.566 billion as of September 27, 2003, indicating a strong liquidity position. This is further supported by the company's working capital of $3.530 billion, which suggests it has the resources to meet its short-term obligations.

The company's gross margin of 27.5% in 2003 was slightly lower than the previous year's 27.9%, indicating some pressure on profitability. This could be due to factors such as pricing pressure, increased component costs, and the company's investments in new products and initiatives.

The company's research and development expenses remained relatively stable at 8% of net sales, suggesting a continued focus on innovation and product development. However, the company's selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 20% of net sales, which could be a concern if the company is unable to leverage these expenses effectively.

Overall, the report suggests that Apple Computer, Inc. is in a reasonably strong financial position, with a healthy liquidity profile and a focus on innovation. However, the company's operating performance and profitability metrics warrant close monitoring to ensure the company can maintain its competitive edge and deliver consistent financial results.
