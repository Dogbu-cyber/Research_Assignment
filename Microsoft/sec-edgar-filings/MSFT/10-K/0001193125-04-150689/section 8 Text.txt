See accompanying notes. PAGE 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries (Microsoft). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercised significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (OCI). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these transactions, we allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped, with a portion of the revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (currently named Software Assurance and, previously named Upgrade Advantage). In addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, Microsoft bCentral subscriptions, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions. PAGE 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Revenue related to our Xbox game console is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers net of allowances for returns and price concessions. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, PC games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. SALES AND MARKETING Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation, and other headcount-related costs as well as expenses related to advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.13 billion in fiscal 2002, $1.06 billion in fiscal 2003, and $904 million in fiscal 2004. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. DERIVATIVE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments include both debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment income. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. The fair value of collateral that we are permitted to sell or repledge was $499 million at both June 30, 2003 and 2004. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. PAGE 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equities price, interest rate, and credit risks. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of OCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. For options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under SFAS 133. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Equities Price Risk. Equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. We determine the security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Once established, the hedges are not dynamically managed or traded, and are generally not removed until maturity. Certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133, are also used to manage equity exposures. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. We use exchange-traded option and future contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133, to hedge interest rate risk. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks. In addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. To Be Announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets are not taken at the earliest available delivery date. All derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in the income statement during the period of change. PAGE 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Balance atbeginning of period Charged to costsand expenses Write-offsand other Balance atend of period 2002 $ 174 $ 192 $ (157 ) $ 209 2003 209 118 (85 ) 242 2004 242 44 (120 ) 166 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less. GOODWILL Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. NOTE 2 UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items: Volume licensing programs – Represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Undelivered elements – Represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop PAGE 42 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Other – Represents primarily payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.

Unrealized losses from fixed income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Of the unrealized losses of $293 million at June 30, 2004,$51 million exceeded twelve months. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2004. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2003, the recorded basis of these investments was $2.15 billion, and their estimated fair value was $2.56 billion. At June 30, 2004 the recorded basis of these investments was $1.65 billion, and their estimated fair value was $2.12 billion. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. The maturities of debt securities at June 30, 2004 were as follows: (In millions) Cost basis Estimated fairvalue Due in one year or less $ 37,348 $ 37,388 Due after one year through five years 14,077 14,064 Due after five years through ten years 5,636 5,665 Due after ten years 4,994 4,956 Total $ 62,055 $ 62,073 Debt securities include fixed maturity securities. NOTE 4 INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS) The components of investment income/(loss) are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Dividends and interest $ 2,119 $ 1,957 $ 1,892 Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments (1,807 ) 44 1,563 Net losses on derivatives (617 ) (424 ) (268 ) Investment income/(loss) $ (305 ) $ 1,577 $ 3,187 Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $4.32 billion in fiscal 2002, $1.15 billion in fiscal 2003, and $82 million in fiscal 2004. Realized gains and (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $3.02 billion and $(504) million in fiscal 2002, $1.44 billion and $(245) million in fiscal 2003, and $2.16 billion and $(518) million in fiscal 2004. NOTE 5 DERIVATIVES For derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS 133, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004. During fiscal 2002, $30 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $331 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income/(loss). During fiscal 2003, $74 million in losses on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $229 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income/(loss). During fiscal 2004, $31 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $325 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income/(loss). PAGE 45 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During fiscal 2002, $234 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $10 million in derivative losses were reclassified to investment income/(loss). During fiscal 2003, $40 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $2 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income/(loss). During fiscal 2004, $14 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and no derivative gains or losses were reclassified to investment income/(loss). We estimate that $119 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. No significant fair value hedges or cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued for fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004.

Our annual testing resulted in no impairment charges to goodwill in fiscal 2003 and 2004. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. During fiscal 2004, we had no material acquisitions. Goodwill decreased $13 million primarily as a result of goodwill allocated to a business that was divested in the current year. The $1.7 billion increase in goodwill during fiscal 2003 related principally to the following acquisitions: Navision a/s with $1.2 billion allocated to Microsoft Business Solutions; $281 million for the Rare Ltd. acquisition allocated to Home and Entertainment; and Placeware, Inc. with $180 million allocated to Information Worker.

Microsoft. No other material intangibles were acquired in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, we recorded additions to intangible assets of $306 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Navision a/s and Rare Ltd., as described at Note 15 – Acquisitions. The components of intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2003 and 2004 are as follows – no significant residual value is estimated for these assets: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2003 2004 Amount Weightedaverage life Amount Weightedaverage life Contract-based $ 162 5 years $ 324 9 years Technology-based 97 4 years 28 4 years Marketing-related 19 4 years – – Customer-related 28 9 years 3 3 years Total $ 306 5 years $ 355 9 years During 2003, research and development assets of $17 million were acquired and written off in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4 (FIN 4), Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. Those write-offs are included in Research and Development expenses. Acquired finite-lived intangibles are generally amortized on a straight line basis over weighted average periods. Intangible assets amortization expense was $161 million for fiscal 2003 and $170 million for fiscal 2004.

We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $2.30 billion of our undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, all of which relate to fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004 earnings, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. PAGE 49 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 On December 3, 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, in part, an earlier U.S. Tax Court decision. In 2004, the remaining issue remanded by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was resolved closing all tax years with the IRS through 1996. The IRS is currently auditing 1997 through 2003. Management believes any adjustments that may ultimately be required will not be material to the financial statements. Income taxes paid were $1.9 billion in fiscal 2002, $2.8 billion in fiscal 2003, and $2.5 billion in fiscal 2004. NOTE 11 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares of common stock outstanding are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Beginning balance 10,766 10,718 10,771 Issued 208 291 215 Repurchased (256 ) (238 ) (124 ) Balance, end of year 10,718 10,771 10,862 As discussed in Note 13 – Employee Stock and Savings Plans, 344.6 million options were transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan) under the stock option transfer program. The options transferred to JPMorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm’s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. As of June 30, 2004, the options have strike prices ranging from $33.03 to $101.25 per share and have expiration dates between December 2005 and December 2006. Our board of directors has approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our stock option and stock purchase plans. A total of 618 million shares have been repurchased on open market transactions over the last three fiscal years for approximately $16.2 billion. We repurchased 256 million shares for $6.9 billion, 238 million shares for $5.9 billion, and 124 million shares for $3.4 billion in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Additionally, in 2002, we acquired 10.2 million of our shares as a result of a structured stock repurchase transaction entered into in 2001, which gave us the right to acquire such shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in Stockholders’ Equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. On January 16 and September 12, 2003, our board of directors declared annual dividends on our common stock of $0.08 and $0.16 per share, respectively. The dividends were paid on March 7 and November 7, 2003, respectively, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, and October 17, 2003.

Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In connection with the use of the retroactive restatement method, income statement amounts have been restated for fiscal 2002 and 2003 to reflect results as if the fair-value method of SFAS 123 had been applied from its original effective date. Total compensation cost recognized in income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $3.78 billion in fiscal 2002, $3.75 billion in fiscal 2003, and $5.73 billion in fiscal 2004. The amounts for fiscal 2004 include $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) due to the completion of the employee stock option transfer program. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of our common stock could be purchased at six month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month period. Employees could purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004 employees purchased 10.8 million shares, 15.2 million shares, and 16.7 million shares at average prices of $25.26, $22.56, and $22.74 per share. At June 30, 2004, 175.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance. PAGE 51 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the administrative committee under the plan approved a change to the common stock purchase discount and approved the elimination of the related look back period and a change to quarterly purchase periods. As a result, effective beginning in fiscal 2005, shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three months intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three month period. Savings Plan. We have a savings plan in the United States, that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 25% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $101 million, $118 million, and $141 million in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. Stock Plans. In fiscal 2004 we implemented changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. In fiscal 2004, we began granting employees stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (“eligible options”) to JPMorgan. The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during the period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003, which was $25.57. A total of 18,503 (51%) of the 36,539 eligible employees elected to participate in the stock option transfer program and 344.6 million (55%) of the 621.4 million eligible options were tendered. Under the terms of the program, JPMorgan paid us $382 million for the transferred options. We made an initial payment of $219 million to participating employees for the transferred options, with a remaining portion to be paid in one or more payments that are subject to participating employees’ continued employment over the next two or three years. The options that were transferred to JPMorgan resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which is reflected in the results of fiscal 2004. This expense consists of the unrecognized compensation costs of the options that were transferred, less the amounts payable applicable to those previously unvested options for which payment is contingent upon continued employment of participating employees. The contingent payments applicable to unvested eligible options that are subject to continued employment of participating employees will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the contingent payments. The stock option transfer program also resulted in a decrease to our long-term deferred tax assets due to the excess of recorded compensation expense for these options over the related tax deduction reported on our tax return. For fiscal 2004, deferred tax assets were reduced by approximately $2.01 billion with an offsetting reduction in paid-in capital, reflecting the reduction of previously recorded deductions reported on our tax return in excess of stock based compensation expense. A description of our stock plans follows. We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants and advisors. The plans provide for awards of stock options and stock awards. At June 30, 2004, an aggregate of 807 million shares were available for future grant under our stock plans. Our plans under which awards may be issued do not contain separate limitations on the number of stock awards; all 807 million shares remaining available for grant at June 30, 2004 could be awarded as stock awards. In addition, awards that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. The options transferred to JPMorgan have been removed from our plans; any options transferred to JPMorgan that expire without being exercised will not become available for grant under any of our plans. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards. Stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. During fiscal 2004, 32.6 million stock awards with a weighted-average fair value of $26.12 per share were granted and generally vest ratably over a five-year period. Approximately 787,000 stock awards vested and 1.1 million stock awards were cancelled during fiscal 2004. PAGE 52 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Shared Performance Stock Awards are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our performance against specified performance targets. The performance period is July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 (January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 for certain executive officers). At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock and stock awards issued will be determined by adjusting upward or downward from the target in a range between 33% and 150% (0% to 150% for certain executive officers). The final performance percentage on which the payout will be based, considering performance metrics established for the performance period, will be determined by the board of directors or a committee of the board in its sole discretion. Shares of stock will be issued at the end of the performance period and as the stock awards vest ratably over the following two years. In fiscal 2004, Shared Performance Stock Awards representing the targeted number of shares for the performance period ending June 30, 2006 were granted in the aggregate amount of 31.7 million shares with a weighted average fair value of $26.08 per share. Because these awards cover a three-year period, Shared Performance Stock Awards will only be awarded in fiscal 2005 and 2006 to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive Shared Performance Stock Awards. No shared performance stock awards vested and 1.2 million shared performance stock awards were cancelled during fiscal 2004. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards are amortized over 5 years using the straight line method. Stock Options. Nonqualified stock options have been granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plans. Nonqualified and incentive stock options have been granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted before 1995 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. At June 30, 2004, stock options for 569 million shares were vested. The weighted average Black-Scholes value of options granted under the stock plans during fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004 was $15.79, $12.08, and $10.13, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants: Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Weighted average expected life in years 7 7 7 Dividend per share $ – $ 0.08 $ 0.16 Volatility 39.0 % 42.0 % 29.5 % Risk-free interest rate 5.4 % 3.9 % 4.1 % Employee stock options outstanding are as follows: (In millions, except per share amounts) Price per Share Shares Range Weightedaverage Balance, June 30, 2001 1,796 $ 0.28 – $59.57 $ 24.77 Granted 82 24.31 – 36.29 31.25 Exercised (198 ) 0.51 – 34.91 6.41 Canceled (76 ) 0.58 – 58.28 34.34 Balance, June 30, 2002 1,604 0.40 – 59.57 26.88 Granted 254 21.42 – 29.12 24.27 Exercised (234 ) 0.51 – 28.22 6.89 Canceled (75 ) 2.13 – 59.56 34.33 Balance, June 30, 2003 1,549 0.40 – 59.56 29.30 Granted 2 25.46 – 29.96 26.76 Exercised (198 ) 0.51 – 29.38 12.21 Stock Option Transfer Program (345 ) 33.03 – 59.56 38.70 Canceled (59 ) 2.31 – 58.28 31.29 Balance, June 30, 2004 949 0.40 – 59.56 29.26 PAGE 53 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 For various price ranges, weighted average characteristics of outstanding employee stock options at June 30, 2004 are as follows: (In millions, except per share amounts and years) Outstanding options Exercisable options Range of exercise prices Shares Remaining life (years) Weightedaverage price Shares Weightedaverage price $ 0.00 – $15.00 37 1.82 $ 6.60 36 $ 6.53 15.01 – 25.00 244 7.24 $ 23.33 75 $ 21.78 25.01 – 33.00 387 5.62 $ 28.24 237 $ 28.17 33.01 – 41.00 169 4.17 $ 34.22 127 $ 34.25 41.01 – 59.56 112 4.40 $ 44.80 94 $ 44.66 949 569 As of June 30, 2004, 345 million transferred options to JP Morgan remained outstanding and are excluded from the amounts noted as employee options outstanding in the tables above. See Note 11. In addition, the tables above include in the total options outstanding 6.8 million options outstanding that were granted in conjunction with corporate acquisitions. These options are included in the option totals; however, they are excluded from the exercise price ranges presented. These options had an exercise price range of $0.00 to $204.09 and a weighted average exercise price of $14.13. NOTE 14 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 5,355 $ 7,531 $ 8,168 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 10,811 10,723 10,803 Dilutive effect of employee stock options and awards 295 159 91 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 11,106 10,882 10,894 Earnings per share: Basic (A/B) $ 0.50 $ 0.70 $ 0.76 Diluted (A/C) $ 0.48 $ 0.69 $ 0.75 For the years ended June 30, 2002, 2003 and 2004, 746 million, 1.09 billion and 1.2 billion shares attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2004, 21.9 million shared performance stock awards, out of 31.7 million targeted amount granted, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in Note 13 – Employee Stock and Savings Plans. PAGE 54 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 15 ACQUISITIONS In fiscal 2004, we had no material acquisitions. In fiscal 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Navision a/s, Rare Ltd., and Placeware, Inc. Navision, headquartered in Vedbaek, Denmark, is a provider of integrated business solutions software for small and mid-sized businesses in the European market that is part of the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. We acquired Navision on July 12, 2002 for $1.465 billion consisting primarily of $662 million in cash and the issuance of 29.1 million common shares of our common stock valued at $773 million. The value of the common shares issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over the two-day period before and after terms of the acquisition were agreed to and approved. Rare is a video game developer located outside Leicestershire, England, that has broaden the portfolio of games available for the Xbox video game system. Rare was acquired on September 24, 2002 for $377 million consisting primarily of $375 million in cash and is included in the Home and Entertainment segment. Placeware, located in Mountain View, California, facilitates secure, highly reliable, cross-firewall Web conferencing experiences allowing users to conduct business meetings online from a PC, and is part of our Real Time Collaboration business unit in the Information Worker segment. Placeware was acquired on April 30, 2003 for $202 million, consisting primarily of $189 million in cash. Navision, Rare, and Placeware have been consolidated into our financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. None of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, pro forma financial information is not included in this note. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisitions for fiscal 2003 are as follows: (In millions) Navision a/s atJuly 12, 2002 Rare Ltd. atSeptember 24,2002 Placeware, Inc. atApril 30, 2003 Current assets $ 240 $ 25 $ 30 Property, plant and equipment 8 8 7 Intangible assets 169 75 30 Goodwill 1,197 281 180 Total assets acquired 1,614 389 247 Current liabilities (148 ) (12 ) (32 ) Long-term liabilities (1 ) – (13 ) Total liabilities assumed (149 ) (12 ) (45 ) Net assets acquired $ 1,465 $ 377 $ 202 The $1.20 billion of goodwill resulting from the Navision acquisition was assigned to the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. Of that total amount, approximately $900 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The $281 million of goodwill in the Rare acquisition was assigned to the Home and Entertainment segment. Of that total amount, approximately $270 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The $180 million of goodwill in the Placeware acquisition was assigned to the Information Worker segment. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

PAGE 55 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $318 million, $290 million, and $331 million in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Amount 2005 $ 148 2006 124 2007 81 2008 62 2009 and thereafter 120 $ 535 We have committed $129 million for constructing new buildings. We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $11 million which was added to the carrying value of the related investment. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of the Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists. We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we can not estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Our product warranty accrual reflects management’s best estimate of our probable liability under its product warranties (primarily relating to the Xbox console). We determine the warranty accrual based on known product failures (if any), historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Our warranty accrual totals $19 million. There has been no significant activity impacting the results of operations for any period presented. PAGE 56 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES Government antitrust cases. We are the defendant in U.S. v. Microsoft and New York v. Microsoft, companion lawsuits filed by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a group of eighteen state Attorneys General alleging violations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. After the trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stating that we had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. A Judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 ordering, among other things, our breakup into two companies. On June 28, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the Judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial on one Section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with its ruling. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals substantially narrowed the bases of liability found by the District Court, but affirmed some of the District Court’s conclusions that we had violated Section 2. We entered into a settlement with the United States on November 2, 2001. Nine states (New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin) agreed to settle on substantially the same terms on November 6, 2001. On November 1, 2002, the Court approved the settlement as being in the public interest, conditioned upon the parties’ agreement to a modification to one provision related to the Court’s ongoing jurisdiction. Two trade groups unsuccessfully sought to intervene to challenge the approval of the settlement and have appealed. Nine states and the District of Columbia continued to litigate the remedies phase of New York v. Microsoft. On November 1, 2002, the Court entered a Final Judgment in this part of the litigation that largely mirrored the settlement between us, the DOJ and the settling states, with some modifications and a different regime for enforcing compliance. The Court declined to impose other and broader remedies sought by the non-settling states. Two states, Massachusetts and West Virginia, appealed from this decision. West Virginia dismissed its appeal as part of a settlement with us of several other cases. On June 30, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the settlement and the Final Judgment. European Commission competition law matter. On March 25, 2004 the European Commission announced a decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft. The Commission concluded that we infringed European competition law by refusing to provide our competitors with licenses to certain protocol technology in the Windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback functionality in Windows desktop operating systems. The Commission ordered us to make the relevant licenses to our technology available to our competitors and to develop and make available a version of the Windows desktop operating system that does not include specified software relating to media playback. The decision also imposed a fine of €497 million, which resulted in a charge of €497 million ($605 million). We filed an appeal of the decision to the Court of First Instance on June 6, 2004 and will seek interim measures suspending the operation of certain provisions of the decision. We contest the conclusion that European competition law was infringed and will defend our position vigorously. A hearing on our petition for interim measures will be held on September 30 – October 1, 2004. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state Attorneys General have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. Antitrust, unfair competition and overcharge class actions. A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts. The federal cases have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. These cases allege that we have competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers’ alleged overcharges for these products. To date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages brought against us by indirect purchasers under federal law and in 14 states. Nine of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. Claims on behalf of foreign purchasers have also been dismissed by the federal court in Maryland. Appeals of these state rulings are pending in two states. Courts in eleven states have ruled that these cases may proceed as class actions, while courts in two states have denied class certification. The Maryland federal District Court has certified a class of direct purchasers of certain of our operating system software that acquired the software from the shop.Microsoft.com web site or pursuant to a direct marketing campaign and otherwise denied certification of the proposed classes. The denial of certification of the proposed classes has been appealed and that appeal is still pending. Members of the certified class licensed fewer than 550,000 copies of at-issue operating system software from us. In September 2003, we reached an agreement with plaintiffs’ counsel to settle that action, which received final approval in April 2004. In 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the California plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. Under the proposed settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers on a PAGE 57 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 claims made basis that entitle the class members to be reimbursed up to the face value of their vouchers for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total amount of vouchers issued will depend on the number of class members who claim and are issued vouchers. Two-thirds of the amount of vouchers unissued or unredeemed by class members will be made available to certain schools in California in the form of vouchers that also may be redeemed for cash against purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware, software and related services. Since the beginning of 2003, we also reached similar agreements to settle all claims in a number of other states. The proposed settlements in these states are structured similarly to the California settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the amounts of vouchers unissued to class members will be made available to certain schools in the relevant states. The maximum amount of vouchers to be issued in these settlements, including the California settlement, is $1.55 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools who are issued and redeem vouchers. The settlements in California, Florida, Kansas, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia have received final approval by the relevant court. The proposed settlements in Arizona, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont have received preliminary approval by the courts in those states, but still require final approval. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. In accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FIN 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, we have recorded a contingent liability of $1.04 billion, net of administrative expenses and legal fees paid. RealNetworks litigation. On December 18, 2003, RealNetworks, Inc. filed suit against us alleging violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws, related to streaming media features of Windows and related technologies. RealNetworks seeks damages and injunctive relief, including a permanent injunction requiring us to offer a version of Windows products with no streaming media features. We deny the allegations and will vigorously defend the action. RealNetworks filed the case in federal court in San Jose, California. It has been consolidated for pretrial purposes with other cases pending in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Patent cases. We are the defendant in more than 30 patent infringement cases that we are defending vigorously. In the case of Eolas Technologies, Inc. and University of California v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 2, 1999, the plaintiffs accused the browser functionality of Windows of infringement. On August 11, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs’ patent issued through September 2001. The plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from September 2001 to the present. On January 14, 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, including post-trial interest of $45 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. We filed our notice of appeal on February 12, 2004. On October 30, 2003, the U.S. Patent Office issued a letter stating that it has initiated a Director-ordered re-examination of the Eolas patent. On February 26, 2004, pursuant to this re-examination proceeding, the Patent Office issued an Office Action rejecting the claims of the Eolas patent. We believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. The actual costs are dependent upon many unknown factors such as success on appeal and the events of a retrial of the case should the case be remanded to trial following appeal. In Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, plaintiff has asserted a family of six patents relating to halftoning which it believes are infringed by certain printing and display functionality allegedly present in different versions of Windows and Office. Plaintiff seeks an as yet unspecified amount of damages in the form of “reasonable royalties” on various Microsoft products dating as far back as Windows and Office 2000. The case is scheduled for trial in April of 2005. In TVI v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, plaintiff accuses the Autoplay feature of Windows of infringement. This case is scheduled for trial in September 2004. In Arendi USA, Inc. and Arendi Holding Limited v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, plaintiff has accused certain Smart Tags features in Microsoft Office XP and Office 2003 of infringing one patent. Trial is scheduled for September, 2004. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us adversely affecting distribution of our operating system or application products. The risks associated with an adverse decision may result in material settlements. PAGE 58 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Sun Microsystems agreements. On April 1, 2004, we entered into a series of agreements with Sun Microsystems, Inc. to resolve all pending litigation between the parties, attempt to avoid future disputes, and create an environment conducive to future cooperation. These agreements included a Settlement Agreement, a Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement, and a Technology Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the agreements, we made payments totaling $1.95 billion to Sun. In the Settlement Agreement, Sun agreed to discontinue its participation in proceedings pending against Microsoft instituted by the Commission of the European Communities and agreed to dismiss with prejudice the action it filed in the Northern District of California, Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., Civil Action No. C-02-01150 RMW (PVT) (N.D. Cal.), and later transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland under MDL Docket No. 1332. Sun released Microsoft from any claims that were or could have been asserted in the proceedings pending before the European Communities, its action pending in the U.S., and any claims based on any actions or events discussed in the Findings of Fact in United States v. Microsoft Corp. and New York, et al. v Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 2002). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Microsoft paid Sun $700 million, which was recorded as litigation related expense. The Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement provides that neither Sun nor Microsoft will sue the other, or certain authorized channel and end user licensees, for damages for past patent infringement. Microsoft has the option of extending this covenant not to sue each year until 2014 in exchange for an annual extension payment, so long as certain conditions are met. The agreement provides that on April 1, 2014, provided that certain conditions are met, the companies will grant each other irrevocable, non-exclusive, perpetual patent licenses, with some reciprocal limitations as to scope and use, as well as an additional ten year covenant not to sue for patent infringement with respect to certain products. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Microsoft paid Sun $900 million, which was recorded as litigation related expense. Sun and Microsoft also entered into a reciprocal Technology Collaboration Agreement. This collaboration agreement provides both companies with access to aspects of each other’s server-based technology for use in developing new server software products and/or enhancing existing server software products, in order to improve interoperability. It provides a perpetual license between Microsoft and Sun pursuant to all subject intellectual property rights (including patents and trade secrets) to enable either company to implement in its server operating system products any server-based communications protocols that are implemented over a seven year period by the other company in order to interoperate with their respectively identified server and/or client operating system products. Royalty obligations incurred by Microsoft for use or inclusion of covered Sun technology in Microsoft products will, as incurred, be credited against the $350 million already paid pursuant to the terms of the Technology Collaboration Agreement, based on royalty rates to be determined in the future by Sun. This license removes concerns under traditional patent and trade secret intellectual property frameworks by enabling Microsoft’s current and future client and server operating system products to interoperate with the most popular Sun products in a wide range of customer computing environments. The extent and timing of Microsoft’s consumption of this credit is subject to uncertainty. Much of the technology that the companies agreed to license to each other does not exist in a useable form and the agreement does not specify individual royalty payments for implementation of specifications for particular communications protocols. After reaching this agreement with Sun, we valued the intellectual property rights received. In determining the fair value of the intellectual property received, we considered the uncertainty associated with the timing and likely use of Sun’s technology, which included estimating the likelihood of adoption of protocols and potential royalties saved. That valuation resulted in a fair value of $29 million for the right to use Sun’s licensed protocols in certain products, which we recorded as an intellectual property asset. Reflecting the uncertainty associated with the timing and likely use of Sun’s technology, the remaining amount of $321 million was recorded as litigation related expense. Intertrust settlement. On April 3, 2004, the previously reported case of InterTrust v. Microsoft was settled by agreement of the parties. Under the terms of this agreement, we have taken a comprehensive license to InterTrust’s patent portfolio, including pending patent applications, and agreed to make a one-time payment to InterTrust of $440 million. The agreement involved a combination of a license of intellectual property assets for which we recorded an intangible asset of $266 million and a payment of $174 million for settlement of legal claims. Of the total payment, $174 million was recovered through insurance and had no impact on our results of operations. The agreement resolves all outstanding litigation between the parties. Other. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations, the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may PAGE 59 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.

In addition, fiscal 2003 information has been restated for certain internal reorganizations and changes to certain internal accounting methods to conform to the current period presentation. It was not practicable to restate fiscal 2002 information for these changes, nor was it practicable to present the current year on a basis consistent with fiscal 2002. SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below: Client – Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. PAGE 60 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Server and Tools – Server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. Also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Information Worker – Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, an allocation for Server CALs, and professional product support services. Microsoft Business Solutions – Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager and other business applications and services. MSN – Personal communication services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels, and paid services including MSN Internet access, MSN Premium Web services, and MSN Mobile service. Mobile and Embedded Devices – Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. Home and Entertainment – Xbox video game system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products. Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, quarter end cut off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate level activity including certain legal settlements and legal contingent liabilities. Significant reconciling items are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 Operating income reconciling amounts: Legal settlements and contingent liabilities (673 ) (1,079 ) (2,778 ) Stock-based compensation expense (3,784 ) (3,749 ) (4,773 ) Revenue reconciling amounts 288 (392 ) 576 Other (889 ) (1,253 ) (2,457 ) Total $ (5,058 ) $ (6,473 ) $ (9,432 ) Other primarily includes corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; and various amounts to conform with U.S. GAAP. PAGE 61 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10% of total fiscal 2004 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and were included in all operating segments. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2002 or 2003. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which we operate, is as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 2004 United States(1) $ 20,066 $ 22,077 $ 25,046 Other countries 8,299 10,110 11,789 Total $ 28,365 $ 32,187 $ 36,835 (1) Includes shipments to customers in the United States, licensing to certain OEMs and multinational organizations, and exports of finished goods, primarily to Asia, Latin America, and Canada.

In addition, the board approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock over the next four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The board also approved a one-time special dividend of $3.00 per share, or approximately $32 billion, subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend. The special dividend will be payable on December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004, conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held November 9, 2004.

PAGE 63 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2003 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
