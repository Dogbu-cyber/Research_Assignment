Summary:
Microsoft's financial health appears strong overall, with solid revenue growth, profitability, and a strong cash position. The company reported net income of $7,346 million and operating income of $11,720 million in fiscal year 2001. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $25,296 million, driven by strong performance in the Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services segment.

The company's balance sheet is healthy, with $31,600 million in cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2001. This provides ample liquidity and financial flexibility. Microsoft also generated $13,422 million in cash from operations during the year, further strengthening its financial position.

However, the company did face some challenges in fiscal 2001, including a $375 million cumulative effect of an accounting change and $4.80 billion in investment impairments, primarily in the cable and telecommunications industries. These one-time items impacted net income, but the core business operations remained strong.

Overall, Microsoft's financial performance and position indicate a healthy, well-managed company capable of generating substantial profits and cash flow. The company's dominant market position, diversified revenue streams, and strong balance sheet suggest it is well-positioned to navigate future challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.
