Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which Microsoft owns at least 20% of the voting securities are accounted for using the equity method, except for investments in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee, in which case, the cost method of accounting is used. Issuances of shares by a subsidiary are accounted for as capital transactions. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include provisions for returns, concessions and bad debts; and the length of product life cycles and buildings' lives. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Revenue Recognition Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when OEMs ship licensed products while revenue from certain license programs is recorded when the software has been delivered and the customer is invoiced. Revenue from packaged product sales to and through distributors and resellers is recorded when related products are shipped. Maintenance and subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including technical support and Internet browser technologies, is based on the average sales price of those elements and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product's life cycle. When the revenue recognition criteria required for distributor and reseller arrangements are not met, revenue is recognized as payments are received. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for certain products, are accrued. Provisions are recorded for returns, concessions, and bad debts. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes direct costs to produce and distribute product and direct costs to provide online services, consulting, product support, and training and certification of system integrators. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, does not materially affect the Company. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $804 million in 1999, $1.23 billion in 2000, and $1.36 billion in 2001. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of this difference is reported as deferred income taxes. Financial Instruments The Company considers all liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments generally mature between three months and six years from the purchase date. All cash and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI). 31 Equity and other investments include debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary losses) are reflected in other comprehensive income. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. Microsoft lends certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment income. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. The fair value of collateral that Microsoft is permitted to sell or repledge was $499 million at June 30, 2001. There was no collateral that Microsoft was permitted to sell or repledge at June 30, 2000. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. The Company employs a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. In the event that the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost; the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors; and the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. In 2001, the Company recognized $4.80 billion in impairments of certain investments, primarily in the cable and telecommunication industries. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, security price, and interest rate risks. The Company's objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures. Foreign Currency Risk --------------------- Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Options used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies. Securities Price Risk --------------------- Strategic equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, the Company uses and designates options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. The security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging is determined by market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Once established, the hedges are not dynamically managed or traded, and are generally not removed until maturity. Interest Rate Risk ------------------ Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. The Company routinely uses options, not designated as hedging instruments, to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates. Other Derivatives ----------------- In addition, the Company may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. For options designated either as fair value or cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 32 Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the software or three years. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from three to seven years. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that an impairment exists. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 will require that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early application permitted in certain circumstances. The Company plans to early adopt SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002 and does not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption. Goodwill amortization was approximately $300 million in fiscal 2001 and approximately $225 million in fiscal 2000. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation. Accounting Change Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. The adoption of SFAS 133 on July 1, 2000, resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to OCI of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). The reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from OCI for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from OCI for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The reduction to OCI was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by reclassifications out of OCI of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. The net derivative losses included in OCI as of July 1, 2000 were reclassified into earnings during the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. The change in accounting from the adoption of SFAS 133 did not materially affect net income in 2001. Unearned Revenue A portion of Microsoft's revenue is earned ratably over the product life cycle or, in the case of subscriptions, over the period of the license agreement. End users receive certain elements of the Company's products over a period of time. These elements include items such as browser technologies and technical support. Consequently, Microsoft's earned revenue reflects the recognition of the fair value of these elements over the product's life cycle. Upon adoption of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, With Respect to 33 Certain Transactions, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company was required to change the methodology of attributing the fair value to undelivered elements. The percentages of undelivered elements in relation to the total arrangement decreased, reducing the amount of Windows and Office revenue treated as unearned, and increasing the amount of revenue recognized upon shipment. The percentage of revenue recognized ratably decreased from a range of 20% to 35% to a range of approximately 15% to 25% of Windows desktop operating systems. For desktop applications, the percentage decreased from approximately 20% to a range of approximately 10% to 20%. The ranges depend on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company extended the life cycle of Windows from two to three years based upon management's review of product shipment cycles. Product life cycles are currently estimated at 18 months for desktop applications. The Company also sells subscriptions to certain products via maintenance and certain organizational license agreements. At June 30, 2000 and 2001, Desktop Applications unearned revenue was $1.84 billion and $2.19 billion. Desktop Platforms unearned revenue was $2.34 billion and $2.59 billion. Enterprise Software and Services unearned revenue was $433 million and $413 million. Unearned revenue associated with Consumer Software, Services, and Devices, and Other was $200 million and $427 million at June 30, 2000 and 2001.

Debt securities maturing beyond 15 years are composed entirely of AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt with a contractual maturity of 30 years. The debt is convertible into AT&T common stock on or after December 1, 2000, or may be redeemed by AT&T upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or after June 1, 2002. Equity securities that are restricted for more than one year or not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2000 and 2001, the estimated fair value of these investments in excess of their recorded basis was $2.70 billion and $161 million, based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. Realized gains and (losses) from equity and other investments (excluding impairments discussed previously) were $786 million and $(2) million in 1999, $1.94 billion and $(10) million in 2000, and $3.03 billion and $(23) million in 2001. Derivatives For the twelve months ended June 30, 2001, investment income included a net unrealized loss of $592 million, comprised of a $214 million gain for changes in the time value of options for fair value hedges, $211 million loss for changes in the time value of options for cash flow hedges, and $595 million loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2001, $214 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $416 million of derivative losses were reclassified to investment income/(loss). The derivative losses reclassified to investment income/(loss) were offset by gains on the item being hedged. The Company estimates that $144 million of net derivative gains included in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. 35 For instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS 133, had no impact on earnings for the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. No fair value hedges or cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued for the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. Investment Income/(Loss) The components of investment income/(loss) are as follows: In Millions / Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dividends $ 118 $ 363 $ 377 Interest 1,030 1,231 1,808 Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments 803 1,732 (2,221) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment income/(loss) $ 1,951 $ 3,326 $ (36) ==================================================================================================== Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consisted of: In Millions / Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current taxes: U.S. and state $ 4,027 $ 4,744 $ 3,243 International 281 535 514 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current taxes 4,308 5,279 3,757 Deferred taxes (202) (425) 47 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Provision for income taxes $ 4,106 $ 4,854 $ 3,804 ==================================================================================================== U.S. and international components of income before income taxes were: In Millions / Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- U.S. $10,649 $11,860 $ 9,189 International 1,242 2,415 2,336 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Income before income taxes $11,891 $14,275 $11,525 ==================================================================================================== In 1999, the effective tax rate was 35.0%, excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of Softimage, Inc. In 2000, the effective tax rate was 34.0%, and included the effect of a 2.5% reduction from the U.S. statutory rate for tax credits and a 1.5% increase for other items. In 2001, the effective tax rate was 33.0%, and included the effect of a 3.1% reduction from the U.S. statutory rate for tax credits and a 1.1% increase for other items. The components of the differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate in 1999 were not significant. Deferred income taxes were: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In Millions / June 30 2000 2001 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deferred income tax assets: Revenue items $ 1,320 $ 1,469 Expense items 2,122 1,761 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deferred income tax assets 3,442 3,230 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deferred income tax liabilities: Unrealized gain on investments (874) (395) International earnings (1,766) (1,667) Other (121) (55) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deferred income tax liabilities $(2,761) $(2,117) ==================================================================================================== During fiscal 2001, the U.S. Tax Court issued an adverse ruling which is being appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for taxes assessed in 1990 and 1991. Income taxes, except for 1990 and 1991 assessments, have been settled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for all years through 1994. The IRS is examining the Company's 36 1995 and 1996 U.S. income tax returns. Management believes any adjustments which may be required will not be material to the financial statements. Income taxes paid were $874 million in 1999, $800 million in 2000, and $1.3 billion in 2001. Convertible Preferred Stock During 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible exchangeable principal-protected preferred stock. The Company's convertible preferred stock matured on December 15, 1999. Each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common shares. Common Stock Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: In Millions / Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance, beginning of year 4,940 5,109 5,283 Issued 213 229 189 Repurchased (44) (55) (89) ------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance, end of year 5,109 5,283 5,383 =================================================================== Repurchase Program The Company repurchases its common shares in the open market to provide shares for issuance to employees under stock option and stock purchase plans. During 1998, the Company executed two forward settlement structured repurchase agreements with an independent third party totaling 42 million shares of stock and paid cash for a portion of the purchase price. In 1999, the Company settled the agreements by returning 28 million shares of stock, based upon the stock price on the date of settlement. The timing and method of settlement were at the discretion of the Company. The differential between the cash paid and the price of Microsoft common stock on the date of the agreement was originally reflected in common stock and paid-in capital. In 2001, the Company entered into a structured stock repurchase transaction giving it the right to acquire 5.1 million of its shares (2.55 million shares in October 2001 and 2.55 million shares in June 2002) in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. Put Warrants To enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft sold put warrants to independent third parties. These put warrants entitled the holders to sell shares of Microsoft common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices. In the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company issued 2.8 million shares to settle a portion of the outstanding put warrants. During fiscal 2001, all the remaining outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised. 37 Other Comprehensive Income The changes in the components of other comprehensive income were as follows: In Millions / Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax effect of $(37) $ -- $ -- $ (75) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net gain on derivative instruments: Unrealized gains, net of tax effect of $246 -- -- 499 Reclassification adjustment for losses included in net income, net of tax effect of $67 -- -- 135 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net gain on derivative instruments -- -- 634 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net unrealized investment gains/(losses): Unrealized holding gains/(losses), net of tax effect of $772 in 1999, $248 in 2000, and $(351) in 2001 1,432 531 (1,200) Reclassification adjustment for gains included in net income, net of tax effect of $(205) in 1999, $(420) in 2000, and $(128) in 2001 (380) (814) (260) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net unrealized investment gains/(losses) 1,052 (283) (1,460) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Translation adjustments and other 69 23 (39) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Other comprehensive income/(loss) $1,121 $(260) $ (940) ============================================================================================================================= The components of accumulated other comprehensive were: In Millions / June 30 2000 2001 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net gains on derivative instruments $ -- $ 177 Net unrealized investment gains 1,676 598 Translation adjustments and other (149) (188) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accumulated other comprehensive income $1,527 $ 587 ========================================================================================================== Employee Stock and Savings Plans Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company has an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of the Company's common stock may be purchased at six- month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During 1999, 2000, and 2001, employees purchased 2.7 million, 2.5 million, and 5.7 million shares at average prices of $52.59, $72.38, and $36.87 per share. At June 30, 2001, 62.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance. Savings Plan The Company has a savings plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 15% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. The Company contributes fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant's earnings. Matching contributions were $49 million, $65 million, and $86 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Stock Option Plans The Company has stock option plans for directors, officers, and employees, which provide for nonqualified and incentive stock options. Options granted prior to 1995 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted between 1995 and 2000 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire after 10 years. Options granted during 2001vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. At June 30, 2001, options for 331 million shares were vested and 550 million shares were available for future grants under the plans. 38 Stock options outstanding were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Price per Share ------------------------------ Weighted Shares Range Average ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance, June 30, 1998 893 $ 0.56 - $ 43.63 $11.94 Granted 78 45.59 - 83.28 54.62 Exercised (175) 0.56 - 53.63 6.29 Canceled (30) 4.25 - 74.28 21.06 ---- Balance, June 30, 1999 766 0.56 - 83.28 23.87 Granted 304 65.56 - 119.13 79.87 Exercised (198) 0.56 - 82.94 9.54 Canceled (40) 4.63 - 116.56 36.50 ---- Balance, June 30, 2000 832 0.56 - 119.13 41.23 Granted 224 41.50 - 80.00 60.84 Exercised (123) 0.59 - 85.81 11.13 Canceled (35) 13.83 - 119.13 63.57 ---- Balance, June 30, 2001 898 0.56 - 119.13 49.54 ========================================================================= For various price ranges, weighted average characteristics of outstanding stock options at June 30, 2001 were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Outstanding Options Exercisable Options ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Range of Remaining Weighted Weighted Exercise Prices Shares Life (Years) Average Price Shares Average Price ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $0.56- $5.97 73 1.6 $ 4.75 67 $ 4.71 5.98- 13.62 75 1.3 11.01 72 11.02 13.63- 29.80 110 3.0 15.06 92 14.92 29.81- 43.62 84 3.6 32.20 52 32.08 43.63- 60.00 191 7.8 55.82 25 53.17 60.01- 83.28 210 6.1 68.28 11 69.20 83.29- 119.13 155 5.5 89.91 12 87.39 ============================================================================================== 39 The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for stock option and employee stock purchase plans. An alternative method of accounting for stock options is SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under SFAS 123, employee stock options are valued at grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and this compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option and employee stock purchase plans been determined as prescribed by SFAS 123, pro forma income statements for 1999, 2000, and 2001 would have been as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reported Pro Forma Reported Pro Forma Reported Pro Forma -------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenue $19,747 $19,747 $22,956 $22,956 $25,296 $25,296 Operating expenses: Cost of revenue 2,814 3,013 3,002 3,277 3,455 3,775 Research and development 2,970 3,479 3,772 4,814 4,379 6,106 Sales and marketing 3,238 3,445 4,126 4,468 4,885 5,888 General and administrative 715 841 1,050 1,284 857 1,184 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total operating expenses 9,737 10,778 11,950 13,843 13,576 16,953 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Operating income 10,010 8,969 11,006 9,113 11,720 8,343 Losses on equity investees and other (70) (70) (57) (57) (159) (159) Investment income/(loss) 1,951 1,951 3,326 3,326 (36) (36) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Income before income taxes 11,891 10,850 14,275 12,382 11,525 8,148 Provision for income taxes 4,106 3,741 4,854 4,210 3,804 2,689 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Income before accounting change 7,785 7,109 9,421 8,172 7,721 5,459 Cumulative effect of accounting change -- -- -- -- (375) (375) ================================================================================================================== Net income $ 7,785 $ 7,109 $ 9,421 $ 8,172 $ 7,346 $ 5,084 ================================================================================================================== Basic earnings per share $ 1.54 $ 1.41 $ 1.81 $ 1.57 $ 1.38 $ 0.95 ================================================================================================================== Diluted earnings per share $ 1.42 $ 1.30 $ 1.70 $ 1.48 $ 1.32 $ 0.91 ================================================================================================================== The weighted average Black-Scholes value of options granted under the stock option plans during 1999, 2000, and 2001 was $20.90, $36.67, and $29.31. Value was estimated using a weighted average expected life of 5.0 years in 1999, 6.2 years in 2000, and 6.4 years in 2001, no dividends, volatility of .32 in 1999, .33 in 2000, and .39 in 2001, and risk-free interest rates of 4.9%, 6.2%, and 5.3% in 1999, 2000, and 2001. 40 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding preferred shares using the "if-converted" method, assumed net-share settlement of common stock structured repurchases, outstanding put warrants using the "reverse treasury stock" method, and outstanding stock options using the "treasury stock" method. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Year Ended June 30 1999 2000 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Income before accounting change $7,785 $9,421 $7,721 Preferred stock dividends 28 13 -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Net income available for common shareholders $7,757 $9,408 $7,721 ========================================================================================== Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock 5,028 5,189 5,341 Dilutive effect of: Common stock under structured repurchases 13 -- -- Put warrants -- 2 21 Preferred stock 16 7 -- Employee stock options 425 338 212 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Common stock and common stock equivalents 5,482 5,536 5,574 ========================================================================================== Earnings per share before accounting change: Basic $ 1.54 $ 1.81 $ 1.45 ========================================================================================== Diluted $ 1.42 $ 1.70 $ 1.38 ========================================================================================== Operational Transactions In November 1998, Microsoft acquired LinkExchange, Inc., a leading provider of online marketing services to Web site owners and small- and medium-sized businesses. Microsoft paid $265 million in stock. In November 1999, Expedia, Inc. completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Expedia, which is majority-owned by Microsoft, is a leading provider of branded online travel services for leisure and small business travelers. Expedia's financial results and financial condition are consolidated with the operations of Microsoft. In January 2000, the Company merged with Visio Corporation in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Microsoft issued 14 million shares in the exchange for the outstanding stock of Visio. Visio's assets and liabilities, which were nominal, are included with those of Microsoft as of the merger. Operating results for Visio from periods prior to the merger were not material to the combined results of the two companies. Accordingly, the financial statements for such periods have not been restated. In July 2000, the Company acquired an interest in Telewest Communications plc for approximately $2.6 billion in stock. Telewest is a leading broadband cable communications operator in the United Kingdom. In April 2001, the Company acquired Great Plains Software, Inc. for approximately $1.1 billion in stock. Great Plains is a leading supplier of mid- market business applications. The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and operating results for Great Plains subsequent to the date of acquisition are included with those of Microsoft. The pro forma impact of Great Plains' operating results prior to the date of acquisition was not material. Commitments The Company has operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $135 million, $201 million, and $281 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are: 2002, $218; 2003, $210; 2004, $185; 2005, $162; 2006, $140; and thereafter, $430. Microsoft has committed $181 million for constructing new buildings and $46 million for the manufacturing of products. In addition, the Company has guaranteed $420 million in debt of its equity investees. 41 Contingencies On January 23, 2001, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") entered into a Settlement Agreement. Under the terms of the public agreement, the parties agreed to a dismissal with prejudice of all pending claims in the suit brought by Sun against Microsoft on October 7, 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Sun also granted to Microsoft a non-exclusive license to continue distribution of certain Sun technology for a seven year period. Microsoft further agreed to pay Sun $20 million. The Company is a defendant in U.S. v. Microsoft, a lawsuit filed by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a group of eighteen state Attorneys General alleging violations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. After the trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stating that Microsoft had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. A Judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 ordering, among other things, the breakup of Microsoft into two companies. The Judgment was stayed pending an appeal. On June 28, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the Judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial on one Section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with its ruling. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals substantially narrowed the bases of liability found by the District Court, but affirmed some of the District Court's conclusions that Microsoft had violated Section 2. On September 6, 2001, the plaintiffs announced that on remand they will not ask the Court to break Microsoft up, that they will seek imposition of conduct remedies, and that they will not retry the one Section 1 claim returned to the District Court by the Court of Appeals. On August 7, 2001, Microsoft petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the appellate court's ruling concerning its disqualification of the District Court judge. Microsoft may petition the Supreme Court to review other aspects of the appellate court's decision after final judgment is entered. In other ongoing investigations, the DOJ and several state Attorneys General have requested information from Microsoft concerning various issues. In addition, the European Commission has instituted proceedings in which it alleges that Microsoft has failed to disclose information that Microsoft competitors claim they need to interoperate fully with Windows 2000 clients and servers and has engaged in discriminatory licensing of such technology. The remedies sought, though not fully defined, include mandatory disclosure of Microsoft Windows operating system technology and imposition of fines. Microsoft denies the European Commission's allegations and intends to contest the proceedings vigorously. A large number of overcharge class action lawsuits have been initiated against Microsoft. These cases allege that Microsoft has competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the complaints contend Microsoft charged for these products. Microsoft believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases. To date, Microsoft has won dismissals of all claims for damages by indirect purchasers under Federal law and in 15 separate state court proceedings. Claims on behalf of foreign purchasers have also been dismissed. Plaintiffs have appealed most of these rulings. While no trials or other proceedings have been held concerning any liability issues, courts in several states have ruled that these cases may proceed as class actions, while one court has denied class certification status to the claims in that state proceeding. Two purported class action employment discrimination cases are pending against Microsoft, Donaldson v. Microsoft, a class case consolidating three separately filed class action complaints filed in October 2000 and February 2001 in Federal court in Seattle, Washington, and Jackson v. Microsoft, an amendment to an existing case alleging class claims filed on January 3, 2001 in Federal court in Washington, D.C. Microsoft's motion to transfer the Jackson case to Federal court in Seattle was granted on May 3, 2001. The Donaldson plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of current and former African American and female Microsoft employees and seek injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. The Jackson plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of current and former African American Microsoft employees and seeks injunctive relief, $5 billion in compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. Both cases allege that Microsoft's compensation, evaluation, and promotion policies are discriminatory with respect to the plaintiffs in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 42 U.S.C. (S) 1981. Microsoft denies the allegations and is vigorously defending both cases. 42 The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a non-public investigation into the Company's accounting reserve practices. Microsoft is also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Management currently believes that resolving these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or its results of operations.

Except for 1999 operating income/(loss), prior year disclosures have been restated for consistent presentation. It is not practicable to discern operating income for 1999 for the current segments due to previous internal reorganizations. Microsoft has four segments: Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services; Consumer Software, Services, and Devices; Consumer Commerce Investments; and Other. Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services operating segment includes Desktop Applications, Desktop Platforms, and Enterprise Software and Services. Desktop Applications include Microsoft Office; Project; Visio; client access licenses for Windows 2000 Server, Windows NT Server, Exchange, and BackOffice; Microsoft Great Plains; and bCentral. Desktop Platforms include Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me), Windows 98, and other desktop operating systems. Enterprise Software and Services includes Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server operating systems, SQL Server and client access licenses, Exchange Server, developer tools, consulting services, product support services, and training and certification. Consumer Software, Services, and Devices operating segment includes MSN Internet access, MSN network services, WebTV Internet access and services, gaming, learning and productivity software, mobile and wireless devices, and embedded systems. Consumer Commerce Investments operating segment includes Expedia, Inc., the HomeAdvisor online real estate service, and the CarPoint online automotive service. Other includes Hardware and Press. Segment information is presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This standard is based on a management approach, which requires segmentation based upon the Company's internal organization and disclosure of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. The Company's financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements (P&Ls) prepared on a basis not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes. 43 Reconciling items for revenue include certain elements of unearned revenue and the treatment of certain channel inventory amounts and estimates. In addition to the reconciling items for revenue, reconciling items for operating income/(loss) include general and administrative expenses ($1,050 million in 2000 and $857 million in 2001), certain research expenses ($141 million in 2000 and $154 million in 2001), and other corporate level adjustments. The internal P&Ls use accelerated methods of depreciation and amortization. Additionally, losses on equity investees and minority interest are classified in operating income for internal reporting presentations. Revenue attributable to U.S. operations includes shipments to customers in the United States, licensing to OEMs and certain multinational organizations, and exports of finished goods, primarily to Asia, Latin America, and Canada. Revenue from U.S. operations totaled $13.7 billion, $15.7 billion, and $17.8 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Revenue from outside the United States, excluding licensing to OEMs and certain multinational organizations and U.S. exports, totaled $6.0 billion, $7.3 billion, and $7.5 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001. A single customer accounted for approximately 11%, 9%, and 8% of revenue in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Long-lived assets totaled $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion in the United States in 2000 and 2001 and $126 million and $154 million in other countries in 2000 and 2001. Subsequent Event On July 16, 2001, USA Networks, Inc. (USA) announced an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Expedia, Inc. through the purchase of up to 37.5 million shares, approximately 75% of the current outstanding shares. If holders of more than 37.5 million Expedia shares elect to sell their shares to USA, there will be a pro rata reduction among all of those electing shareholders. Microsoft has agreed to transfer all of its 33.7 million shares and warrants, subject to pro- ration. It is expected that the transaction will close by December 31, 2001. 44 Quarterly Information (In millions, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Quarter Ended --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept. 30 Dec. 31 Mar. 31 June 30 Year --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1999 Revenue $4,193 $5,195 $4,595 $5,764 $19,747 Gross profit 3,544 4,407 3,887 5,095 16,933 Net income 1,683 1,983 1,917 2,202 7,785 Basic earnings per share 0.34 0.40 0.38 0.43 1.54 Diluted earnings per share 0.31 0.36 0.35 0.40 1.42 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2000 Revenue $5,384 $6,112 $5,656 $5,804 $22,956 Gross profit 4,672 5,356 4,904 5,022 19,954 Net income 2,191 2,436 2,385 2,409 9,421 Basic earnings per share 0.43 0.47 0.46 0.46 1.81 Diluted earnings per share 0.40 0.44 0.43 0.44 1.70 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2001 Revenue (1) $5,766 $6,550 $6,403 $6,577 $25,296 Gross profit 4,941 5,686 5,504 5,710 21,841 Net income (2)(3) 2,206 2,624 2,451 65 7,346 Basic earnings per share (2)(3) 0.42 0.49 0.46 0.01 1.38 Diluted earnings per share (2)(3) 0.40 0.47 0.44 0.01 1.32 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) For the first three quarters of 2001, revenue and cost of revenue have been reclassified to report Expedia merchant revenue on a net basis, which represents the amount charged to the customer less the amount paid to the supplier.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in the notes to the financial statements, the Company was required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective July 1, 2000.
