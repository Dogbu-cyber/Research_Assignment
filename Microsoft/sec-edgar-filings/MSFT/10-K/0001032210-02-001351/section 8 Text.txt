accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries (Microsoft). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which Microsoft owns at least 20% of the voting securities are accounted for using the equity method, except for investments in which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee, in which case, the cost method of accounting is used. Issuances of shares by a subsidiary are accounted for as capital transactions. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when the Company reaches technological feasibility for its products; the potential outcome of the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (OCI). Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. REVENUE RECOGNITION Microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. For software arrangements with multiple elements, revenue is recognized dependent upon whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for each of the elements. When VSOE does not exist for all the elements of a software arrangement and the only undelivered element is postcontract customer support (PCS), the entire licensing fee is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including technical support and Internet browser technologies, is based on the average sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product’s life cycle. PCS and subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) is based on the licensing agreement with an OEM and has historically been recognized when OEMs ship licensed products to their customers. Licensing provisions were modified with the introduction of Windows XP in 2002 and revenue for certain products is recorded upon shipment of the product to OEMs. The effect of this change in licensing provisions was not material. Revenue from packaged product sales to distributors and resellers is usually recorded when related products are shipped. However, when the revenue recognition criteria required for distributor and reseller arrangements are not met, revenue is recognized as payments are received. Revenue related to the Company’s Xbox game console is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for certain products, are accrued. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. COST OF REVENUE Cost of revenue includes direct costs to manufacture and distribute product and direct costs to provide online services, consulting, product support, and training and certification of system integrators. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Technological feasibility for Microsoft’s software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, the Company expenses all research and development costs when incurred. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.23 billion in 2000, $1.36 billion in 2001, and $1.27 billion in 2002. 23 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 INCOME TAXES Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of this difference is reported as deferred income taxes. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company considers all liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments generally mature between three months and six years from the purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments include debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. Microsoft lends certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment income. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. The fair value of collateral that Microsoft is permitted to sell or repledge was $499 million at both June 30, 2001 and 2002. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. The Company employs a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. In the event that the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost; the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors; and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. In 2001, the Company recognized $4.80 billion in impairments of certain investments, primarily in the cable and telecommunication industries. In 2002, Microsoft recognized $4.32 billion in impairments of certain investments, primarily related to further declines in the fair values of U.S. and European cable and telecommunications holdings. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, security price, and interest rate risks. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Options used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies. Securities Price Risk. Strategic equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, the Company uses and designates options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. The security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging is determined by market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Once established, the hedges are not dynamically managed or traded, and are generally not removed until maturity. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. The Company routinely uses options, not designated as hedging instruments, to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates. Other Derivatives. In addition, the Company may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. For options designated either as fair value or cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the account receivable balance. Management determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: In Millions Year Ended June 30 Balance at beginning of period Charged to costs and expenses Write-offs and other Balance at end of period 2002 $ 174 $ 192 $ 157 $ 209 2001 186 157 169 174 2000 204 77 95 186 24 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally not in excess of three years. GOODWILL Beginning in fiscal 2002 with the adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period of benefit. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from three to seven years. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that an impairment exists. All of Microsoft’s intangible assets are subject to amortization. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation. NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The adoption of SFAS 133 on July 1, 2000, resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to OCI of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). The reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from OCI for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from OCI for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The reduction to OCI was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by reclassifications out of OCI of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. The net derivative losses included in OCI as of July 1, 2000 were reclassified into earnings during the twelve months ended June 30, 2001. The change in accounting from the adoption of SFAS 133 did not materially affect net income in 2001. Effective July 1, 2001, Microsoft adopted SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. There was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of SFAS 142. Net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001 adjusted to exclude amortization expense (net of taxes) is as follows: In Millions, Except Earnings Per Share Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 Net income: Reported net income $ 9,421 $ 7,346 Goodwill amortization 203 252 Equity method goodwill amortization 1 26 Adjusted net income $ 9,625 $ 7,624 Basic earnings per share: Reported basic earnings per share $ 1.81 $ 1.38 Goodwill amortization 0.04 0.05 Equity method goodwill amortization – – Adjusted basic earnings per share $ 1.85 $ 1.43 Diluted earnings per share: Reported diluted earnings per share $ 1.70 $ 1.32 Goodwill amortization 0.04 0.05 Equity method goodwill amortization – – Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.74 $ 1.37 25 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 3 UNEARNED REVENUE A portion of Microsoft’s revenue under volume licensing programs is earned ratably over the period of the license agreement. Also, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including technical support and Internet browser technologies, is based on the average sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recognized ratably for undelivered elements ranges from approximately 20% to 25% for Windows XP Home, approximately 10% to 15% for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 10% to 15% for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three years for Windows operating systems and 18 months for desktop applications. The components of unearned revenue were as follows: In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Volume licensing programs $ 1,922 $ 4,158 Undelivered elements 2,818 2,830 Other 874 755 Unearned revenue $ 5,614 $ 7,743 Unearned revenue by product was as follows: In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Desktop Applications $ 2,189 $ 3,489 Desktop Platforms 2,586 3,198 Enterprise Software and Services 391 791 Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services 5,166 7,478 Consumer Software, Services, and Devices, and Other 448 265 Unearned revenue $ 5,614 $ 7,743 Of the $7.74 billion of unearned revenue at June 30, 2002, $2.28 billion is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, $1.64 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, $1.18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, $817 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and $1.82 billion thereafter. 26 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 4 CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS In Millions June 30, 2001 CostBasis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and equivalents: Cash $ 1,145 $ – $ – $ 1,145 Commercial paper 894 – – 894 Certificates of deposit 286 – – 286 U.S. government and agency securities 400 – – 400 Corporate notes and bonds 1,130 – – 1,130 Municipal securities 67 – – 67 Cash and equivalents 3,922 – – 3,922 Short-term investments: Commercial paper 635 3 – 638 U.S. government and agency securities 7,355 9 (42 ) 7,322 Corporate notes and bonds 17,256 214 (149 ) 17,321 Municipal securities 1,662 41 – 1,703 Certificates of deposit 694 – – 694 Short-term investments 27,602 267 (191 ) 27,678 Cash and short-term investments $ 31,524 $ 267 $ (191 ) $ 31,600 In Millions June 30, 2002 CostBasis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and equivalents: Cash $ 1,114 $ – $ – $ 1,114 Commercial paper 260 – – 260 Certificates of deposit 31 – – 31 Money market mutual funds 714 – – 714 Corporate notes and bonds 560 – – 560 Municipal securities 337 – – 337 Cash and equivalents 3,016 – – 3,016 Short-term investments: Commercial paper 552 – – 552 U.S. government and agency securities 10,726 114 (13 ) 10,827 Corporate notes and bonds 18,822 255 (241 ) 18,836 Municipal securities 4,462 86 – 4,548 Certificates of deposit 873 – – 873 Short-term investments 35,435 455 (254 ) 35,636 Cash and short-term investments $ 38,451 $ 455 $ (254 ) $ 38,652 Realized gains and (losses) from cash and short-term investments were $80 million and $(226) million in 2000, $541 million and $(369) million in 2001, and $816 million and $(558) million in 2002. 27 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 5 INVENTORIES In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Finished goods $ 78 $ 505 Raw materials and work in process 5 168 Inventories $ 83 $ 673 NOTE 6 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Land $ 185 $ 197 Buildings 1,584 1,701 Computer equipment and software 2,292 2,621 Other 1,214 1,372 Property and equipment – at cost 5,275 5,891 Accumulated depreciation (2,966 ) (3,623 ) Property and equipment – net $ 2,309 $ 2,268 During 2000, 2001, and 2002, depreciation expense, of which the majority related to computer equipment, was $668 million, $764 million, and $820 million.

Debt securities maturing beyond 15 years are composed entirely of AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt with a contractual maturity of 30 years. The debt is convertible at the Company’s option into AT&T common stock on or after December 1, 2000, or may be redeemed by AT&T upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or after June 1, 2002. In connection with the definitive agreement to combine AT&T Broadband with Comcast in a new company to be called AT&T Comcast Corporation, Microsoft has agreed to exchange its AT&T 5% convertible preferred debt securities for approximately 115 million shares of AT&T Comcast Corporation. It is expected that the transaction will close by December 31, 2002. While it is possible that Microsoft could incur a loss on this exchange transaction up to the carrying value of the AT&T debt securities, management believes that the ultimate loss, if any, will be significantly less. As management is unable to predict whether there will be a gain or loss on the exchange, no loss has been recorded related to this contingent exchange transaction as of June 30, 2002. Equity securities that are restricted for more than one year or not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2001 the estimated fair value of these investments in excess of their recorded basis was $161 million. At June 30, 2002 the recorded basis of these investments in excess of their estimated fair value was $34 million. This excess of cost over estimated fair value was deemed temporary in nature. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. Realized gains and (losses) from equity and other investments (excluding impairments discussed previously) were $1.94 billion and $(10) million in 2000, $3.03 billion and $(23) million in 2001, and $2.24 billion and $(121) million in 2002. NOTE 8 GOODWILL During fiscal 2002, goodwill was reduced by $85 million, principally in connection with Microsoft’s exchange of all of its 33.7 million shares and warrants of Expedia, Inc. to USA Networks, Inc. No goodwill was acquired or impaired during fiscal 2002. As of June 30, 2002, Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services goodwill was $1.1 billion, Consumer Software, Services, and Devices goodwill was $258 million, and Consumer Commerce Investments goodwill was $72 million. NOTE 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS During fiscal 2002, changes in intangible assets primarily relates to the Company’s acquisition of $25 million in patents and licenses and $27 million in existing technology, which will be amortized over approximately 3 years. No significant residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. Intangible assets amortization expense was $202 million for fiscal 2001 and $194 million for fiscal 2002. The components of intangible assets were as follows: In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Patents and licenses $ 407 $ (177 ) $ 421 $ (290 ) Existing technology 157 (27 ) 172 (71 ) Trademarks, tradenames and other 83 (42 ) 15 (4 ) Intangible assets $ 647 $ (246 ) $ 608 $ (365 ) Amortization expense for the net carrying amount of intangible assets at June 30, 2002 is estimated to be $115 million in fiscal 2003, $90 million in fiscal 2004, $36 million in fiscal 2005, and $2 million in fiscal 2006. 29 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 10 DERIVATIVES For fiscal 2001, investment income included a net unrealized loss of $592 million, comprised of a $214 million gain for changes in the time value of options for fair value hedges, $211 million loss for changes in the time value of options for cash flow hedges, and $595 million loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. For fiscal 2002, investment income included a net unrealized loss of $480 million, comprised of a $30 million gain for changes in the time value of options for fair value hedges, $331 million loss for changes in the time value of options for cash flow hedges, and $179 million net loss for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During fiscal 2001, $214 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $416 million of derivative losses were reclassified to investment income/(loss). During fiscal 2002, $234 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $10 million of derivative losses were reclassified to investment income/(loss). The derivative losses reclassified to investment income/(loss) were offset by gains on the item being hedged. The Company estimates that $63 million of net derivative gains included in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. For instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS 133, had no impact on earnings for the fiscal 2001 and 2002. No fair value hedges or cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued for fiscal 2001 and 2002. NOTE 11 INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS) The components of investment income/(loss) are as follows: In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Dividends $ 363 $ 377 $ 357 Interest 1,231 1,808 1,762 Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments: Net gains on the sales of investments 1,780 3,175 2,379 Other-than-temporary impairments (29 ) (4,804 ) (4,323 ) Net unrealized losses attributable to derivative instruments (19 ) (592 ) (480 ) Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments 1,732 (2,221 ) (2,424 ) Investment income/(loss) $ 3,326 $ (36 ) $ (305 ) NOTE 12 INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consisted of: In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Current taxes: U.S. and state $ 4,744 $ 3,243 $ 3,644 International 535 514 575 Current taxes 5,279 3,757 4,219 Deferred taxes (425 ) 47 (535 ) Provision for income taxes $ 4,854 $ 3,804 $ 3,684 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes were: In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 U.S. $ 11,860 $ 9,189 $ 8,920 International 2,415 2,336 2,593 Income before income taxes $ 14,275 $ 11,525 $ 11,513 30 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 In 2000, the effective tax rate was 34.0%, and included the effect of a 2.5% reduction from the U.S. statutory rate for tax credits and a 1.5% increase for other items. In 2001, the effective tax rate was 33.0%, and included the effect of a 3.1% reduction from the U.S. statutory rate for tax credits and a 1.1% increase for other items. The effective tax rate in 2002 was 32.0%, and included the effect of a 2.4% reduction from the U.S. statutory rate for the extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit and a 0.6% reduction for other items. Deferred income taxes were: In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Deferred income tax assets: Revenue items $ 1,469 $ 2,261 Expense items 691 945 Impaired investments 1,070 2,016 Deferred income tax assets $ 3,230 $ 5,222 Deferred income tax liabilities: Unrealized gain on investments $ (395 ) $ (887 ) International earnings (1,667 ) (1,818 ) Other (55 ) (803 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,117 ) $ (3,508 ) Microsoft has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $780 million of its undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, all of which relate to fiscal 2002 earnings, since these earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. On September 15, 2000, the U.S. Tax Court issued an adverse ruling with respect to Microsoft’s claim that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) incorrectly assessed taxes for 1990 and 1991. The Company has filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on this matter. Income taxes, except for items related to the 1990 and 1991 assessments, have been settled with the IRS for all years through 1996. The IRS is examining the Company’s 1997 through 1999 U.S. income tax returns. Management believes any adjustments which may be required will not be material to the financial statements. Income taxes paid were $800 million in 2000, $1.3 billion in 2001, and $1.9 billion in 2002. NOTE 13 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Balance, beginning of year 5,109 5,283 5,383 Issued 229 189 104 Repurchased (55 ) (89 ) (128 ) Balance, end of year 5,283 5,383 5,359 The Company repurchases its common shares in the open market to provide shares for issuance to employees under stock option and stock purchase plans. In 2002, the Company acquired 5.1 million of its shares as a result of a structured stock repurchase transaction entered into in 2001, which gave it the right to acquire such shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. To enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft has sold put warrants to independent third parties. These put warrants entitled the holders to sell shares of Microsoft common stock to the Company on certain dates at specified prices. In the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company issued 2.8 million shares to settle a portion of the outstanding put warrants. At June 30, 2001 and 2002, there were no outstanding put warrants. During 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible exchangeable principal-protected preferred stock. The Company’s convertible preferred stock matured on December 15, 1999. Each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common shares. 31 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 14 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax effect of $(37) $ – $ (75 ) $ – Net gains/(losses) on derivative instruments: Unrealized gains, net of tax effect of $246 in 2001 and $30 in 2002 – 499 55 Reclassification adjustment for (gains)/losses included in net income, net of tax effectof $67 in 2001 and $(79) in 2002 – 135 (146 ) Net gains/(losses) on derivative instruments – 634 (91 ) Net unrealized investment gains/(losses): Unrealized holding gains/(losses), net of tax effect of $248 in 2000, $(351) in 2001,and $(955) in 2002 531 (1,200 ) (1,774 ) Reclassification adjustment for (gains)/losses included in net income, net of tax effectof $(420) in 2000, $(128) in 2001, and $958 in 2002 (814 ) (260 ) 1,779 Net unrealized investment gains/(losses) (283 ) (1,460 ) 5 Translation adjustments and other 23 (39 ) 82 Other comprehensive income/(loss) $ (260 ) $ (940 ) $ (4 ) The components of accumulated other comprehensive income were: In Millions June 30 2001 2002 Net gains on derivative instruments $ 177 $ 86 Net unrealized investment gains 598 603 Translation adjustments and other (188 ) (106 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income $ 587 $ 583 NOTE 15 EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Company has an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under the plan, shares of the Company’s common stock may be purchased at six-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During 2000, 2001, and 2002, employees purchased 2.5 million, 5.7 million, and 5.4 million shares at average prices of $72.38, $36.87, and $50.52 per share. At June 30, 2002, 56.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance. SAVINGS PLAN The Company has a savings plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 25% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. The Company contributes fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions were $47 million, $63 million, and $77 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. STOCK OPTION PLANS The Company has stock option plans for directors, officers, and employees, which provide for nonqualified and incentive stock options. Options granted prior to 1995 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire after 10 years. Options granted during 2002 vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. At June 30, 2002, options for 371 million shares were vested and 543 million shares were available for future grants under the plans. 32 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Stock options outstanding were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Price per Share Shares Range Weighted Average Balance, June 30, 1999 766 $ 0.56 – $ 83.28 $ 23.87 Granted 304 65.56 – 119.13 79.87 Exercised (198 ) 0.56 – 82.94 9.54 Canceled (40 ) 4.63 – 116.56 36.50 Balance, June 30, 2000 832 0.56 – 119.13 41.23 Granted 224 41.50 – 80.00 60.84 Exercised (123 ) 0.59 – 85.81 11.13 Canceled (35 ) 13.83 – 119.13 63.57 Balance, June 30, 2001 898 0.56 – 119.13 49.54 Granted 41 48.62 – 72.57 62.50 Exercised (99 ) 1.02 – 69.81 12.82 Canceled (38 ) 1.15 – 116.56 68.67 Balance, June 30, 2002 802 0.79 – 119.13 53.75 For various price ranges, weighted average characteristics of outstanding stock options at June 30, 2002 were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Outstanding Options Exercisable Options Range of Exercise Prices Shares Remaining Life (Years) Weighted Average Price Shares Weighted Average Price $ 0.79 – $ 5.97 36 1.6 $ 4.83 35 $ 4.82 5.98 – 13.62 44 0.5 11.19 42 11.18 13.63 – 29.80 90 2.0 15.02 84 14.97 29.81 – 43.62 73 2.7 32.19 66 32.09 43.63 – 60.00 191 6.9 55.81 41 54.03 60.01 – 69.50 146 6.4 66.24 35 66.53 69.51 – 83.28 80 5.1 71.17 21 71.84 83.29 – 119.13 142 4.2 89.87 47 89.29 The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for stock option and employee stock purchase plans. An alternative method of accounting for stock options is SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Employee stock options are valued at grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and this compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period. 33 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock option and employee stock purchase plans been determined as prescribed by SFAS 123, pro forma income statements for 2000, 2001, and 2002 would have been as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Reported Pro Forma Reported Pro Forma Reported Pro Forma Revenue $ 22,956 $ 22,956 $ 25,296 $ 25,296 $ 28,365 $ 28,365 Operating expenses: Cost of revenue 3,002 3,277 3,455 3,775 5,191 5,699 Research and development 3,772 4,814 4,379 6,106 4,307 6,299 Sales and marketing 4,126 4,468 4,885 5,888 5,407 6,252 General and administrative 1,050 1,284 857 1,184 1,550 1,843 Total operating expenses 11,950 13,843 13,576 16,953 16,455 20,093 Operating income 11,006 9,113 11,720 8,343 11,910 8,272 Losses on equity investees and other (57 ) (57 ) (159 ) (159 ) (92 ) (92 ) Investment income/(loss) 3,326 3,326 (36 ) (36 ) (305 ) (305 ) Income before income taxes 14,275 12,382 11,525 8,148 11,513 7,875 Provision for income taxes 4,854 4,210 3,804 2,689 3,684 2,520 Income before accounting change 9,421 8,172 7,721 5,459 7,829 5,355 Cumulative effect of accounting change – – (375 ) (375 ) – – Net income $ 9,421 $ 8,172 $ 7,346 $ 5,084 $ 7,829 $ 5,355 Basic earnings per share $ 1.81 $ 1.57 $ 1.38 $ 0.95 $ 1.45 $ 0.99 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.70 $ 1.48 $ 1.32 $ 0.91 $ 1.41 $ 0.98 The weighted average Black-Scholes value of options granted under the stock option plans during 2000, 2001, and 2002 was $36.67, $29.31, and $31.57. Value was estimated using a weighted average expected life of 6.2 years in 2000, 6.4 years in 2001, and 7.0 years in 2002, no dividends, volatility of .33 in 2000, .39 in 2001, and .39 in 2002, and risk-free interest rates of 6.2%, 5.3%, and 5.4% in 2000, 2001, and 2002. 34 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 16 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding preferred shares using the “if-converted” method, outstanding put warrants using the “reverse treasury stock” method, and outstanding stock options using the “treasury stock” method. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Income before accounting change $ 9,421 $ 7,721 $ 7,829 Preferred stock dividends 13 – – Net income available for common shareholders $ 9,408 $ 7,721 $ 7,829 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock 5,189 5,341 5,406 Dilutive effect of: Put warrants 2 21 – Preferred stock 7 – – Employee stock options 338 212 147 Common stock and common stock equivalents 5,536 5,574 5,553 Earnings per share before accounting change: Basic $ 1.81 $ 1.45 $ 1.45 Diluted $ 1.70 $ 1.38 $ 1.41 For the years ended June 30, 2000, 2001 and 2002, 45 million, 351 million, and 373 million shares attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive. NOTE 17 OPERATIONAL TRANSACTIONS In January 2000, the Company acquired Visio Corporation in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Microsoft issued 14 million shares valued at approximately $1.5 billion in the exchange for the outstanding stock of Visio. Visio’s assets and liabilities, which were nominal, are included with those of Microsoft as of the merger. Operating results for Visio from periods prior to the merger were not material to the combined results of the two companies. Accordingly, the financial statements for such periods have not been restated. In April 2001, the Company acquired Great Plains Software, Inc. for approximately $1.1 billion in stock. Great Plains is a leading supplier of mid-market business applications. The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and operating results for Great Plains subsequent to the date of acquisition are included with those of Microsoft. The pro forma impact of Great Plains’ operating results prior to the date of acquisition was not material. NOTE 18 COMMITMENTS The Company has operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $201 million, $281 million, and $318 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are: 2003, $260; 2004, $219; 2005, $197; 2006, $170; 2007, $135; and thereafter, $302. Microsoft has committed $111 million for constructing new buildings. In addition, the Company has guaranteed $536 million in debt of its equity investees. NOTE 19 CONTINGENCIES The Company is a defendant in U.S. v. Microsoft, a lawsuit filed by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a group of eighteen state Attorneys General alleging violations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. After the trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stating that Microsoft had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. A Judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 ordering, among other things, the breakup of Microsoft into two companies. 35 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The Judgment was stayed pending an appeal. On June 28, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the Judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial on one Section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with its ruling. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals substantially narrowed the bases of liability found by the District Court, but affirmed some of the District Court’s conclusions that Microsoft had violated Section 2. On October 12, 2001, the trial court held a status conference and entered orders requiring the parties to engage in settlement discussions until November 2, 2001. Microsoft entered into a settlement with the United States on November 2, 2001. Nine states (New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin) agreed to settle on substantially the same terms on November 6, 2001. A hearing on the settlement was held by the Court on March 6, 2002. The Court will now decide whether to approve the settlement as being in the public interest. Nine states and the District of Columbia continue to litigate the remedies phase of U.S. v. Microsoft. The non-settling states are seeking imposition of a remedy that would impose much broader restrictions on Microsoft’s business than the proposed settlement with the DOJ and nine other states. The Court conducted an evidentiary hearing related to the non-settling states’ proposed remedies from March 18 to June 19, 2002. A decision is anticipated later in calendar 2002. In other ongoing investigations, the DOJ and several state Attorneys General have requested information from Microsoft concerning various issues. In addition, the European Commission has instituted proceedings in which it alleges that Microsoft has failed to disclose information that Microsoft competitors claim they need to interoperate fully with Windows 2000 clients and servers and has engaged in discriminatory licensing of such technology, as well as improper bundling of multimedia playback technology in the Windows operating system. The remedies sought, though not fully defined, include mandatory disclosure of Microsoft Windows operating system technology and imposition of fines. Microsoft denies the European Commission’s allegations and intends to contest the proceedings vigorously. A large number of overcharge class action lawsuits have been initiated against Microsoft in various state and Federal courts. These cases allege that Microsoft has competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the complaints contend Microsoft charged for these products. Microsoft believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases. To date, Microsoft has won dismissals of all claims for damages by indirect purchasers under Federal law and in 17 separate state court proceedings, of which seven have been affirmed and one has been reversed. Claims on behalf of foreign purchasers have also been dismissed. Appeals of several of these rulings are still pending. No trials or other proceedings have been held concerning any liability issues. Courts in several states have ruled that these cases may proceed as class actions, while two courts have denied class certification status to the claims in that state proceeding and another has ruled that no class action is available for claims in that state. In fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a contingent liability of approximately $660 million representing management’s estimate of the costs of resolving the contingency. Management’s contingent liability estimate is based upon a proposed settlement between Microsoft and lead counsel for the Federal plaintiffs. While the proposed settlement was not approved by the District Court, management believes that the proposal represents the best estimate of the costs of resolving the contingency based on currently available information. The Company intends to continue vigorously defending these lawsuits. Netscape Communications Inc., a subsidiary of AOL-Time Warner Inc., filed suit against Microsoft on January 22, 2002 in Federal court in the District of Columbia, alleging violations of antitrust and unfair competition laws and other tort claims relating to Netscape and its Navigator browser. The complaint includes claims of unlawful monopolization or attempted monopolization of alleged markets for operating systems and Web browsers, illegal tying of operating systems and browsers, and tortuous interference with Netscape’s business relations. Netscape seeks injunctive relief, unquantified treble damages and its fees and costs. Microsoft denies these allegations and will vigorously defend this action. The case has been transferred for pretrial purposes to the District Court in Baltimore, Maryland and is being coordinated with the overcharge class actions described above. Be Incorporated, a former software development company whose assets were acquired by Palm Incorporated in August 2001, filed suit against Microsoft on February 18, 2002 in Federal court in San Francisco, alleging violations of Federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and other tort claims. Be alleges that Microsoft’s license agreements with computer manufacturers, pricing policies, and business practices interfered with Be’s relationships with computer manufacturers and discouraged them from adopting Be’s own operating system for their products. Be is seeking unquantified treble and punitive damages for its alleged injuries along with its fees and costs. Microsoft denies these allegations and will vigorously defend this action. The case has been transferred for pretrial purposes to the District Court in Baltimore, Maryland and is being coordinated with the overcharge class actions described above. On March 8, 2002, Sun Microsystems, Inc. filed suit against Microsoft alleging violations of Federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws as well as claims under the Federal Copyright Act. Sun seeks injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages along with its fees and costs. Microsoft denies these allegations and will vigorously defend this action. The case has been transferred for pretrial purposes to the District Court in Baltimore, Maryland and is being coordinated with the overcharge class actions described above. On June 3, 2002, Microsoft and the Securities and Exchange Commission entered into an administrative settlement resolving a non-public investigation of certain of Microsoft’s accounting and record keeping practices during fiscal years 1995 through 1998 (SEC File No. 3-10789). The settlement provides that Microsoft will not violate securities regulations that require companies to make accurate filings and maintain sufficient records and controls. The settlement has no impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company is also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. Management currently believes that resolving all of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or its results of operations. 36 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 20 SEGMENT INFORMATION In Millions Year Ended June 30 Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services ConsumerSoftware, Services, and Devices Consumer Commerce Investments Other Reconciling Amounts Consolidated 2000 Revenue $ 20,410 $ 1,654 $ 182 $ 691 $ 19 $ 22,956 Operating income/(loss) 13,210 (1,090 ) (60 ) 86 (1,140 ) 11,006 2001 Revenue $ 22,720 $ 1,961 $ 522 $ 652 $ (559 ) $ 25,296 Operating income/(loss) 14,261 (1,666 ) (222 ) 97 (750 ) 11,720 2002 Revenue $ 23,786 $ 3,531 $ 245 $ 537 $ 266 $ 28,365 Operating income/(loss) 14,671 (1,778 ) 23 59 (1,065 ) 11,910 Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services Revenue: In Millions Year Ended June 30 2000 2001 2002 Desktop Applications $ 9,013 $ 9,580 $ 9,327 Desktop Platforms 7,383 8,265 9,276 Desktop Software 16,396 17,845 18,603 Enterprise Software and Services 4,014 4,875 5,183 Total Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services $ 20,410 $ 22,720 $ 23,786 In fiscal 2002, Microsoft had four segments: Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services; Consumer Software, Services, and Devices; Consumer Commerce Investments; and Other.

The Company’s financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements (P&Ls) prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. Reconciling items for revenue include certain elements of unearned revenue and the treatment of certain channel inventory amounts and estimates. In addition to the reconciling items for revenue, reconciling items for operating income/(loss) include general and administrative expenses ($1.05 billion in 2000, $857 million in 2001, and $1.55 billion in 2002), certain research expenses ($141 million in 2000, $154 million in 2001, and $166 million in 2002), and other corporate level adjustments. The internal P&Ls use accelerated methods of depreciation and amortization. Additionally, losses on equity investees and minority interests are classified in operating income for internal reporting presentations. 37 / MSFT 2002 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Revenue attributable to U.S. operations includes shipments to customers in the United States, licensing to OEMs and certain multinational organizations, and exports of finished goods, primarily to Asia, Latin America, and Canada.
