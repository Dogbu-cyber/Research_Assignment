Item 8 life). The $1,197 million of goodwill was assigned to the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. Of that total amount, approximately $900 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Of the $75 million of acquired intangible assets in the Rare acquisition, $13 million was assigned to research and development assets that were written off in accordance with FIN 4. Those write-offs are included in Research and Development expenses. The remaining $62 million of acquired intangible assets have a weighted average useful life of approximately five years. The intangible assets that make up that amount include technology of $36 million (five-year weighted average useful life), contracts of $16 million (five-year weighted average useful life), and marketing of $10 million (five-year weighted average useful life). The $281 million of goodwill was assigned to the Home and Entertainment segment. Of that total amount, approximately $270 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The $30 million of acquired intangible assets in the Placeware acquisition have a weighted average useful life of approximately eight years. The intangible assets that make up that amount include technology of $4 million (four-year weighted-average useful life), customers of $23 million (ten-year weighted-average useful life), contracts of $1 million (six-year weighted-average useful life), and marketing of $2 million (one-year weighted average useful life). The $180 million of goodwill was assigned to the Information Worker segment. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Note 19—Commitments and Guarantees We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $281 million, $318 million, and $290 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are: 2004, $218; 2005, $202; 2006, $172; 2007, $134; 2008, $116; and thereafter, $429. We have committed $117 million for constructing new buildings. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 elaborates on previously existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter’s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of the Jupiter’s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2003, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists. We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Our product warranty accrual reflects management’s best estimate of probable liability under its product warranties (primarily relating to the Xbox console). We determine the warranty accrual based on known product failures (if any), historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Changes in the product warranty accrual for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 were as follows (in millions): Balance, beginning of period $ 8 Payments made – Change in liability for warranties issued during the period 29 Change in liability for preexisting warranties (25 ) Balance, end of period $ 12 Note 20—Contingencies We are a defendant in U.S. v. Microsoft and New York v. Microsoft, companion lawsuits filed by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a group of eighteen state Attorneys General alleging violations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. After the trial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stating that we had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws. A Judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 ordering, among 35 / MSFT 2003 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II, Item 8 other things, our breakup into two companies. The Judgment was stayed pending an appeal. On June 28, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the Judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial on one Section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with its ruling. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals substantially narrowed the bases of liability found by the District Court, but affirmed some of the District Court’s conclusions that we had violated Section 2. We entered into a settlement with the United States on November 2, 2001. Nine states (New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin) agreed to settle on substantially the same terms on November 6, 2001. On November 1, 2002, the Court approved the settlement as being in the public interest, conditioned upon the parties’ agreement to a modification to one provision related to the Court’s ongoing jurisdiction. Nine states and the District of Columbia continued to litigate the remedies phase of New York v. Microsoft. The non-settling states sought remedies that would have imposed much broader restrictions on our business than the settlement with the DOJ and nine other states. On November 1, 2002, the Court entered a Final Judgment in this part of the litigation that largely mirrored the settlement between us, the DOJ and the settling states, with some modifications and a different regime for enforcing compliance. The Court declined to impose other and broader remedies sought by the non-settling states. Two states, Massachusetts and West Virginia, appealed from this decision of the trial court, and West Virginia dismissed its appeal as part of a settlement with us of several other cases. The European Commission has instituted proceedings in which it alleges that we have failed to disclose information that our competitors claim they need to interoperate fully with Windows 2000 clients and servers and that we have engaged in discriminatory licensing of such technology, as well as improper bundling of multimedia playback technology in the Windows operating system. The remedies sought, though not fully defined, include mandatory disclosure of our Windows operating system technology, either the removal of Windows Media technology from Windows or a “must carry” obligation requiring OEMs to install competitive media players with Windows, and imposition of fines in an amount that could be as large as 10% of our worldwide annual revenue. We deny the European Commission’s allegations and intend to contest the proceedings vigorously. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state Attorneys General have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and Federal courts. The Federal cases have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. These cases allege that we have competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers overcharges we allegedly charged for these products. To date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages against us by indirect purchasers under Federal law and in 16 different states. Nine of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. Claims on behalf of foreign purchasers have also been dismissed. Appeals of several of these rulings are still pending. No trials have been held concerning any liability issues. Courts in ten states have ruled that these cases may proceed as class actions, while courts in two states have denied class certification status, and another court has ruled that no class action is available for antitrust claims in that state. The Federal District Court has certified a class of direct purchasers of our operating system software that acquired the software from the shop.Microsoft.com Web site or pursuant to a direct marketing campaign and otherwise denied certification of the proposed classes. Members of the certified class licensed fewer than 550,000 copies of operating system software from Microsoft. In 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the California plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. Under the proposed settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers with a total face value of up to $1.1 billion that may be redeemed for cash against purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. Two-thirds of the amount unclaimed or unredeemed by class members then will be made available to certain schools in California in the form of vouchers that also may be redeemed for cash against purchased of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware, software and related services. The court in California preliminarily approved this proposed settlement, but it still requires final approval by the court. In 2003, we also reached similar agreements to settle all claims in Montana, Florida, West Virginia and North Carolina. The total face value of the Montana settlement is $12.3 million, the Florida settlement, $202 million, the West Virginia settlement, $21 million, and the North Carolina settlement, $89.2 million. These proposed settlements are structured similar to the California settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the amounts unclaimed by class members will be made available to certain schools in Montana, Florida, West Virginia and North Carolina. The proposed settlements in Montana, Florida and West Virginia have been preliminarily approved by the courts in those states, but still require final approval. The parties have filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in North Carolina and the Court has scheduled a hearing for later this year. We intend to continue vigorously defending the remaining lawsuits. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $916 million and $1.1 billion with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. In accordance with SFAS 5 and FIN 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, the Company has recorded a contingent liability of $916 million. Netscape Communications Inc., a subsidiary of AOL-Time Warner Inc., filed suit against us on January 22, 2002 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of antitrust and unfair competition laws and other tort claims relating to Netscape and its Navigator browser. The case was transferred for pretrial purposes to the District Court in Baltimore, Maryland and was being coordinated with the antitrust and unfair competition class actions described above. On May 29, 2003, we and AOL Time Warner announced an agreement to settle the case. As part of the settlement, we paid $750 million to AOL Time Warner and provided AOL Time Warner a royalty-free, seven-year license to use Microsoft Internet Explorer technologies with the AOL client. The parties agreed on various other technical provisions and entered into a separate agreement to collaborate on long-term digital media initiatives designed to accelerate the adoption of digital content. The two companies entered into a long-term, non-exclusive license agreement allowing AOL Time Warner to use our Windows Media 9 Series and future software for creating, distributing and playing back high-quality digital media. As a result of the settlement, the case has been dismissed with prejudice. Be Incorporated, a former software development company whose assets were acquired by Palm, Inc. in August 2001, filed suit against us on February 18, 2002 in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, alleging violations of Federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and other tort claims. Be alleges that our license agreements with computer manufacturers, pricing 36 / MSFT 2003 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II, Item 8 policies, and business practices interfered with Be’s relationships with computer manufacturers and discouraged them from adopting Be’s own operating system for their products. We believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. On March 8, 2002, Sun Microsystems, Inc. filed suit against us alleging violations of Federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws as well as claims under the Federal Copyright Act. Sun seeks injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages along with its fees and costs. We deny these allegations and will vigorously defend this action. The case has been transferred for pretrial purposes to the U.S. District Court in Baltimore, Maryland and is being coordinated with the antitrust and unfair competition class actions described above. On January 21, 2003, the Court granted Sun’s motion for a preliminary injunction and entered an injunction requiring us to distribute certain Sun Java software with Microsoft Windows XP and certain other products. The injunction also prohibits us from distributing our version of Java software in a variety of ways. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted our request for a stay of the preliminary injunction order. On June 26, 2003, a three judge panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a unanimous opinion vacating the preliminary injunction requiring us to distribute Sun Java software and upheld the preliminary injunction prohibiting us from distributing our version of Java software in certain ways. We are the defendant in more than 30 patent infringement cases. Several of these cases are approaching trial. In the case of Eolas Technologies, Inc. and University of California v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 2, 1999, the plaintiffs accused the browser functionality of Windows of infringement. On August 11, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs’ patent issued through September 2001. The plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from September 2001 to the present. We will appeal the jury award and any award on the equitable accounting issue upon conclusion of those aspects of the case that remain to be completed before the trial court. While it is not currently possible to estimate the range of possible loss, we believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. However, the actual costs are dependent upon many unknown factors such as the outcome of issues remaining to be decided by the trial court, success on appeal, and the events of a retrial of the case should the case be remanded to trial following appeal. The trial of InterTrust v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern California on April 26, 2001, is anticipated in 2005. The plaintiff in this case has accused a large number of products, including Windows and Office, of infringement. In each of Eolas and InterTrust, injunctive relief also may be awarded that could adversely impact distribution of Windows or Office. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations, the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. Note 21—Segment Information (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2002 2003 Revenue Client $ 9,350 $ 10,286 Server and Tools 5,632 6,519 Information Worker 8,328 9,718 Microsoft Business Solutions 308 577 MSN 1,924 2,363 Mobile and Embedded Devices 124 153 Home and Entertainment 2,411 2,779 Reconciling Amounts 288 (208 ) Consolidated Revenue $ 28,365 $ 32,187 Operating Income/(Loss) Client $ 7,529 $ 8,281 Server and Tools 1,409 1,848 Information Worker 6,440 7,393 Microsoft Business Solutions (196 ) (308 ) MSN (746 ) (394 ) Mobile and Embedded Devices (240 ) (175 ) Home and Entertainment (866 ) (940 ) Reconciling Amounts (1,420 ) (2,488 ) Consolidated Operating Income/(Loss) $ 11,910 $ 13,217 Segment information is presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This standard is based on a management approach, which requires segmentation based upon our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements (P&Ls) prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is 37 / MSFT 2003 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II, Item 8 impracticable for the Company to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. On July 1, 2002, we revised our segments. These changes are designed to promote better alignment of strategies and objectives between development, sales, marketing, and services organizations; provide for more timely and rational allocation of development, sales, and marketing resources within businesses; and focus long-term planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives. Our seven new segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. Prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the seven new segments. It is not practical to discern operating income for 2001 for the current segments or operating income for 2003 for the previous segments due to reorganizations. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Due to our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of development, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. The Client segment includes revenue and operating expenses associated with Windows XP, Windows 2000, and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools segment consists of revenue and operating expenses associated with server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Information Worker segment includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, an allocation for CALs, and professional product support services. Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Navision, and bCentral. MSN includes MSN Subscription and MSN Network services. Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to state revenue and operating income in accordance with U.S. GAAP and corporate level expenses not specifically attributed to a segment. For revenue, reconciling items include certain undelivered elements of unearned revenue and allowances for certain sales returns and rebates. Reconciling items for operating income/(loss) include general and administrative expenses ($1.55 billion in 2002 and $2.10 billion in 2003), broad-based research and development expenses ($202 million in 2002 and $210 million in 2003), and certain corporate level sales and marketing costs ($526 million in 2002 and $688 million in 2003). The internal segment operating income or loss also includes non-GAAP accelerated methods of depreciation and amortization. Additionally, losses on equity investees and minority interest are classified in operating income for internal reporting presentations. Revenue attributable to U.S. operations includes shipments to customers in the United States, licensing to OEMs and certain multinational organizations, and exports of finished goods, primarily to Asia, Latin America, and Canada. Revenue from U.S. operations totaled $17.8 billion, $20.9 billion, and $22.1 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Revenue from outside the United States, excluding licensing to OEMs and certain multinational organizations and U.S. exports, totaled $7.5 billion, $7.5 billion, and $10.1 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2001, 2002, or 2003. Long-lived assets (principally property and equipment) totaled $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in the United States in 2002 and 2003 and $220 million, and $294 million in other countries in 2002 and 2003. 38 / MSFT 2003 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II, Item 8 QUARTERLY INFORMATION (In millions, except earnings per share) (Unaudited) Quarter Ended Sept. 30 Dec. 31 Mar. 31 June 30 Year Fiscal 2001 Revenue $ 5,766 $ 6,550 $ 6,403 $ 6,577 $ 25,296 Gross profit 4,941 5,686 5,504 5,710 21,841 Net income 2,206 (2) 2,624 2,451 65 (3) 7,346 Basic earnings per share(1) 0.21 (2) 0.25 0.23 0.01 0.69 Diluted earnings per share(1) 0.20 (2) 0.24 0.22 0.01 0.66 Fiscal 2002 Revenue $ 6,126 $ 7,741 $ 7,245 $ 7,253 $ 28,365 Gross profit 5,242 6,197 5,850 5,885 23,174 Net income 1,283 (4) 2,283 2,738 (5) 1,525 (6) 7,829 Basic earnings per share(1) 0.12 0.21 0.25 0.14 0.72 Diluted earnings per share(1) 0.12 0.21 0.25 0.14 0.70 Fiscal 2003 Revenue $ 7,746 $ 8,541 $ 7,835 $ 8,065 $ 32,187 Gross profit 6,547 6,507 6,620 6,827 26,501 Net income 2,726 2,552 2,794 1,921 9,993 Basic earnings per share 0.25 0.24 0.26 0.18 0.93 Diluted earnings per share 0.25 0.23 0.26 0.18 0.92 (1) Earnings per share have been restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split in February 2003.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As described in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective July 1, 2000, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective July 1, 2001. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington July 17, 2003 (September 3, 2003 as to certain information in Note 20) 40 / MSFT 2003 FORM 10-K Table of Contents Part II,
