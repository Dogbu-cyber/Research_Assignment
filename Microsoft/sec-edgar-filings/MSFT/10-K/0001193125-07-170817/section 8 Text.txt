PAGE 43 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. A portion of the revenue related to certain products, which include all Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (Software Assurance). In addition, other multi-year licensing PAGE 44 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions. Revenue related to our Xbox game console and other hardware components is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized based on percentage of completion. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, PC games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, warranties, and bad debts. COST OF REVENUE Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. We determined that technological feasibility was reached with Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly, we capitalized approximately $120 million of software development costs. Previously, costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred. SALES AND MARKETING Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.33 billion, $1.23 billion, and $995 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method. Changes in market value are reflected in OCI (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). PAGE 45 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Equity and other investments may include both debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Changes in market value are reflected in OCI (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. For options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Equities Price Risk. Equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities. We determine the security, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are also used to manage equity exposures. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. We use exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, to hedge interest rate risk. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. In addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. “To Be PAGE 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets in not taken at the earliest available delivery date. All derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Balance atbeginning of year Charged to costs and expenses Write-offs and other Balance at end of year 2005 166 48 (43 ) $ 171 2006 171 40 (69 ) 142 2007 142 64 (89 ) $ 117 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less. GOODWILL Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. PRODUCT WARRANTY We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. PAGE 47 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN No. 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN No. 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. Based on our current assessment, the adoption of FIN No. 48 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by $200 million to $400 million upon adoption. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43.” EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements. In fiscal year 2007, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and provides for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have an impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 157 would have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. NOTE 2 UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items: Volume licensing programs – Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Undelivered elements – Represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. This revenue deferral is applicable for Windows XP and previous PC operating systems shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP PAGE 48 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Professional, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems. Other – Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions maintenance and enhancement billings, Xbox Live and other billings that are accounted for as subscriptions, and other agreements where Microsoft is committed to the delivery of future enhancements, products, or services.

At June 30, 2006, unrealized losses of $243 million consisted of: $196 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $12 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $2 million related to domestic equity securities, and $33 million related to international equity securities. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2007. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2007, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $38 million. At June 30, 2006, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $41 million. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. PAGE 51 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The maturities of debt securities, including fixed-maturity securities, at June 30, 2007 were as follows: (In millions) Cost basis Estimated fairvalue Due in one year or less $ 5,519 $ 5,518 Due after one year through five years 6,886 6,849 Due after five years through ten years 2,935 2,890 Due after ten years 4,910 4,853 Total $ 20,250 $ 20,110 NOTE 4 INVESTMENT INCOME AND OTHER The components of investment income and other were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Dividends and interest $ 1,319 $ 1,510 $ 1,460 Net gains on investments 650 161 856 Net losses on derivatives (358 ) (99 ) (262 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other (34 ) 218 13 Investment income and other $ 1,577 $ 1,790 $ 2,067 Net gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments. These were not material in fiscal year 2007, were $408 million in fiscal year 2006, and were $152 million in fiscal year 2005. The decrease in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2007 and the increase in fiscal year 2006 were driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on July 20, 2006. Realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $851 million and $176 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2007, $1.11 billion and $531 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2006, and $1.38 billion and $376 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2005. NOTE 5 DERIVATIVES For derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal years 2007, 2006, or 2005. During fiscal year 2007, $219 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $361 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $79 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $116 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During fiscal year 2007, $168 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. During fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $57 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $33 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. We estimate that $124 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. No significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements generally range from two to ten years – representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions, computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. Land is not depreciated. During fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, depreciation expense was $1.17 billion, $863 million, and $723 million, respectively. The majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment. NOTE 8 GOODWILL Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 by segment were as follows: (In millions) Balance asof June 30,2005 Acquisitions Other Balance asof June 30,2006 Acquisitions Other Balance asof June 30,2007 Client $ 43 $ 31 $ – $ 74 $ 6 $ (3 ) $ 77 Server and Tools 241 29 (14 ) 256 325 (1 ) 580 Microsoft Business Division 2,435 246 – 2,681 508 (57 ) 3,132 Online Services Business 171 263 21 455 123 (26 ) 552 Entertainment and Devices Division 419 23 (42 ) 400 21 (2 ) 419 Total $ 3,309 $ 592 $ (35 ) $ 3,866 $ 983 $ (89 ) $ 4,760 We test goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would PAGE 53 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. During fiscal year 2007, we acquired the following entities for total consideration of $1.34 billion, which was primarily paid in cash: • Softricity, Inc., a provider of application virtualization and dynamic streaming technologies; • TellMe Networks, Inc., a company specializing in speech-recognition technology providing an outsourced, network-based, voice application platform; and • 11 other entities specializing in areas such as application security, desktop, and data management. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $983 million of goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of the entities were consolidated with Microsoft since their respective acquisition dates. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, were not material. NOTE 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS The components of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows: (In millions) June 30 2007 2006 Grosscarryingamount Accumulatedamortization Net carryingamount Grosscarryingamount Accumulatedamortization Net carryingamount Contract-based $ 988 $ (727 ) $ 261 $ 954 $ (661 ) $ 293 Technology-based 916 (407 ) 509 458 (255 ) 203 Marketing-related 57 (39 ) 18 42 (32 ) 10 Customer-related 122 (32 ) 90 54 (21 ) 33 Total $ 2,083 $ (1,205 ) $ 878 $ 1,508 $ (969 ) $ 539 During fiscal year 2007 and 2006, we recorded additions to intangible assets of $473 million and $189 million, respectively. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. The components of finite-lived intangible assets acquired during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 Amount Weightedaverage life Amount Weightedaverage life Contract-based $ 57 5 years $ 36 4 years Technology-based 333 4 years 140 4 years Marketing-related 14 4 years 5 3 years Customer-related 69 5 years 8 4 years Total $ 473 $ 189 Intangible asset additions include $170 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average life of 4 years, and $84 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average life of 4.9 years, related to the acquisitions of Softricity Inc., TellMe Networks, Inc., and the remaining 11 entities acquired. PAGE 54 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Acquired intangibles are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over weighted average lives. Intangible assets amortization expense was $236 million for fiscal year 2007, $127 million for fiscal year 2006, and $161 million for fiscal year 2005. The estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets as of June 30, 2007 is as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Amount 2008 $ 263 2009 229 2010 184 2011 111 2012 and thereafter 91 Total $ 878 NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Current taxes: U.S. Federal $ 4,593 $ 4,471 $ 3,401 U.S. State and Local 154 101 152 International 957 882 911 Current taxes 5,704 5,454 4,464 Deferred taxes (benefits) 332 209 (90 ) Provision for income taxes $ 6,036 $ 5,663 $ 4,374 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 U.S. $ 12,902 $ 11,404 $ 9,806 International 7,199 6,858 6,822 Income before income taxes $ 20,101 $ 18,262 $ 16,628 The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows: Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (5.1 )% (4.6 )% (3.1 )% Examination settlements – (0.6 )% (4.7 )% Other reconciling items 0.1 % 1.2 % (0.9 )% Effective rate 30.0 % 31.0 % 26.3 % PAGE 55 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The 2007 other reconciling items includes the impact of a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments. The 2006 other reconciling item includes the impact of the $351 million non-deductible European Commission fine. The 2005 other reconciling items include a $179 million repatriation tax benefit under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30 2007 2006 Deferred income tax assets: Stock-based compensation expense $ 2,859 $ 3,630 Other expense items 1,735 1,451 Unearned revenue 842 1,028 Impaired investments 710 989 Other revenue items 58 102 Deferred income tax assets $ 6,204 $ 7,200 Deferred income tax liabilities: International earnings $ (1,763 ) $ (1,715 ) Unrealized gain on investments (926 ) (801 ) Other (227 ) (133 ) Deferred income tax liabilities (2,916 ) (2,649 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 3,288 $ 4,551 Reported as: Current deferred tax assets $ 1,899 $ 1,940 Long-term deferred tax assets 1,389 2,611 Net deferred income tax assets $ 3,288 $ 4,551 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $6.10 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the United States. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $1.77 million. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was enacted in October 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Under these provisions, we repatriated approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction and we recorded a corresponding tax provision benefit of $179 million from the reversal of previously provided U.S. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings in 2005. The dividend was paid in June 2006. Income taxes paid were $5.24 billion in fiscal year 2007, $4.78 billion in fiscal year 2006, and $4.33 billion in fiscal year 2005. Tax Contingencies. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. PAGE 56 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions, the non-current portion of which is included in other long-term liabilities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter, which matters result primarily from inter-company transfer pricing, restructuring of foreign operations, tax benefits from the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extra Territorial Income tax rules, the amount of research and experimentation tax credits claimed, state income taxes, and certain other matters. Although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain; therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audit settlements and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. If we were to settle an audit or a matter under litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed and closed its audits of our consolidated federal income tax returns through 1999. The IRS is currently conducting audits of our consolidated federal income tax return for tax years 2000 through 2006.

On July 20, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.00 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.84 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.00 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately PAGE 57 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 $16.16 billion. As a result, we are authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.16 billion through June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2007, approximately $15.14 billion remained of the $36.16 billion approved repurchase amount. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754 million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under a previously approved plan. Under these repurchase plans, we have made the following share repurchases: (In millions) Fiscal year 2007(1) 2006(2) 2005(2) Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount First quarter 285 $ 6,965 114 $ 3,029 23 $ 625 Second quarter 205 6,037 283 7,666 23 655 Third quarter 238 6,744 181 4,879 95 2,420 Fourth quarter 243 7,367 176 4,175 171 4,302 Total 971 $ 27,113 754 $ 19,749 312 $ 8,002 (1) Approximately 155 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.84 billion were repurchased under our tender offer in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.

Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Stock-Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The stock-based compensation and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,550 $ 1,715 $ 2,448 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation $ 542 $ 600 $ 857 PAGE 59 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares: (Shares In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Shares purchased 17 17 16 Average price per share $ 25.36 $ 23.02 $ 23.33 At June 30, 2007, 125 million shares were reserved for future issuance. Savings Plan. We have a savings plan in the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $218 million, $178 million, and $154 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. Stock Plans. We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. At June 30, 2007, an aggregate of 819 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. The options transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JPMorgan”) (see below) in fiscal year 2004 have been removed from our plans; the options transferred to JPMorgan that expired without being exercised are not available for grant under any of our plans. We issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises. On November 9, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our Board of Directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. Additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. Strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. Stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. As a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on December 2, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96 million options and 7 million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. In addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 4 million shares. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards. Stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. Our stock awards generally vest over a five-year period. Shared Performance Stock Awards (“SPSAs”) are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. The performance period for SPSAs issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 (January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 for certain executive officers). Following the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the number of shares of stock awards to be issued was 37.0 million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. One-third of the awards vested in fiscal year 2007. An additional one-third of the awards will vest over each of the following two years. Because the SPSAs covered a three-year period, SPSAs issued in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive SPSAs. The Company granted SPSAs for fiscal year 2007 with a performance period of July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage is determined based on performance against metrics for the performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. An additional 15% of the total stock and stock awards will be available as PAGE 60 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 additional awards to participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award will vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares will vest over each of the following three years. We measure the fair value of SAs and SPSAs based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. SAs and SPSAs are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method. The fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Dividend per share (quarterly amounts) $ 0.09 - $0.10 $ 0.08 - $0.09 $ 0.08 Interest rates range 4.3% - 5.3% 3.2% - 5.3% 1.3% - 4.3% During fiscal year 2007, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Shares(in millions) WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value Stock awards: Nonvested balance at June 30, 2006 98 $ 24.25 Granted 57 25.15 Vested (24 ) 24.15 Forfeited (7 ) 24.44 Nonvested balance at June 30, 2007 124 $ 24.67 Shared performance stock awards: Nonvested balance at June 30, 2006 37 $ 23.57 Granted 11 25.18 Vested (13 ) 23.74 Forfeited (2 ) 23.92 Nonvested balance at June 30, 2007 33 $ 24.11 As of June 30, 2007, there were $2.22 billion and $392 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years and 2.1 years, respectively. SPSAs granted in fiscal year 2007 include adjustments for estimated performance against performance targets. During the 12 months ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005, the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions, except fair values) Fiscal Year2006 Fiscal Year2005 Stock awards granted 47 41 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 24.70 $ 24.03 Shared performance stock awards granted 3 4 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 24.80 $ 24.35 Stock Options. In fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees stock awards rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. Since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. Nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan. Nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and PAGE 61 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Approximately 3 million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. No stock options were granted during the year ended June 30, 2005. During fiscal year 2004, we completed an employee stock option transfer program whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to JPMorgan. The options transferred to JPMorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm’s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. As a result of this program, we recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. In December 2006, JP Morgan Chase Bank (“JPMorgan”) exercised approximately 113 million call options for $3.25 billion at an average price per share of $28.80. The call options were among 345 million options acquired by JPMorgan in fiscal year 2004 through our employee stock option transfer program. The other approximately 232 million options expired unexercised. Employee stock options outstanding were as follows: Shares(in millions) WeightedAverageExercise Price WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm (years) AggregateIntrinsicValue (in millions) Balance, June 30, 2006 750 $ 27.92 Granted 3 27.28 Exercised (134 ) 23.66 Canceled (92 ) 34.46 Forfeited (3 ) 21.51 Balance, June 30, 2007 524 $ 27.86 3.60 $ 1,877 Exercisable, June 30, 2007 511 $ 27.98 3.55 $ 1,773 Included in the options outstanding balance are approximately 5 million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. While these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise prices presented. These options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $10.35. During fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 818 $ 491 $ 940 Total fair value of stock awards vested 618 377 198 Total fair value of shared performance stock awards vested 316 – – Cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $6.35 billion and $286 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2007. NOTE 15 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using PAGE 62 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 14,065 $ 12,599 $ 12,254 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 9,742 10,438 10,839 Dilutive effect of employee stock options and awards 144 93 67 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 9,886 10,531 10,906 Earnings per share: Basic (A/B) $ 1.44 $ 1.21 $ 1.13 Diluted (A/C) $ 1.42 $ 1.20 $ 1.12 For the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005, 199 million, 649 million, and 854 million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2007, 4 million shared performance stock awards, out of the 14 million targeted amount outstanding, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in Note 14 – Employee Stock and Savings Plans. NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES We have committed $821 million for constructing new buildings. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $326 million, $276 million, and $299 million, in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Amount 2008 $ 349 2009 242 2010 202 2011 174 2012 and thereafter 374 $ 1,341 In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. During 2007, we exercised a provision in the operating lease agreements to purchase the outstanding portion of certain operating leases for approximately $41 million and are no longer subject to the residual value guarantees. We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification PAGE 63 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. In July 2007, we expanded our global Xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. The basic Xbox 360 console warranty remains in place with a warranty period of one year from the date of purchase in most geographies. The changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows: (In millions) Amount Balance at July 1, 2005 $ 14 Accruals for warranties issued 45 Adjustments to pre-existing warranties (7 ) Settlements of warranty claims (42 ) Balance at June 30, 2006 10 Accruals for warranties issued(1) 974 Adjustments to pre-existing warranties 92 Settlements of warranty claims (226 ) Balance at June 30, 2007 $ 850 (1) Includes warranty expense incurred as a result of the expansion of our Xbox 360 warranty coverage as discussed above. NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES Government competition law matters. In March 2004, the European Commission issued a decision in its competition law investigation of us. The Commission concluded that we infringed European competition law by refusing to license to our competitors certain protocol technology in the Windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback features in Windows desktop operating systems. The Commission ordered us to license the protocol technology to our competitors and to develop and make available a version of the Windows desktop operating system that does not include specified media playback software. The Commission also fined us €497 million ($605 million). We appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance. In July 2006, the European Commission determined that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements of the 2004 Decision, and fined us €281 million ($351 million). We have appealed this fine to the Court of First Instance. We have expensed and paid both fines, pending resolution of the appeals. In March 2007, the European Commission announced a new statement of objections. The new statement of objections claims that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing certain server protocol technology as required by the March 2004 decision are “not PAGE 64 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 reasonable.” The statement of objections threatens to impose new fines of up to €500,000 ($675,000) per day from December 2005 to June 2006, up to €2 million ($3 million) per day from June to July 2006, and up to €3 million ($4 million) per day beginning August 2006. The maximum amount of the potential fine as of June 30, 2007 is $1.58 billion. We have submitted a written response to the statement of objections and are seeking to determine a reasonable royalty rate with the Commission. In December 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”) ruled that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the Korean Fair Trade Act. The KFTC stated we violated the Act by building instant messaging and media player features into the Windows PC operating system and streaming media technologies into the Windows server operating system. The KFTC imposed a fine of approximately $34 million which we have expensed and paid. The KFTC’s order issued in February 2006 held that our integration of these media and messaging features into the Windows PC and server operating systems was an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the Korean Fair Trade Act. The order required us to develop and distribute in Korea versions of Windows XP and its successors that do not include Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger functionality. We also may distribute a second modified version of Windows that contains the media and messenger features, as long as it includes promotional links to certain competing media players and instant messengers. We have appealed the KFTC’s decision to the Seoul High Court. In May 2006, the KFTC denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling, but also dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including media player or instant messaging functionality in any product other than the Windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. Antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions. A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software products. We obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. Courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. We have reached agreements to settle all claims in 20 states. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. The settlements in all states but Iowa have received final court approval. Settlements in Arkansas and Wisconsin received final court approval in March 2007. The Iowa case settled in February 2007 and the court gave its preliminary approval of the settlement in April 2007. The cases in Mississippi have not been settled. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. The actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. At June 30, 2007, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $500 million, mostly for administrative expenses and legal fees. Other antitrust litigation and claims. In November 2004, Novell, Inc. filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Utah, now consolidated with other cases in Maryland, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. An appeal of that ruling is now pending and the case is effectively stayed during the appeal. Patent and intellectual property claims. We are vigorously defending more than 45 patent infringement cases. In the case of Eolas Technologies, Inc. and University of California v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court in Illinois in 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of Windows. In January 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. We appealed and in March 2005 the PAGE 65 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, based on certain evidentiary rulings of the trial court. The appellate court also reversed the trial court’s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct. Trial has been postponed indefinitely while the parties seek to settle the matter. A settlement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent Matters. Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent are parties to a number of legal proceedings relating to certain patents of each of the companies. Some of these actions began before the merger of Alcatel and Lucent in 2006. For simplicity, we refer to the post-merger entity of Alcatel-Lucent throughout the following discussion. • In 2003, we filed an action in U.S. District Court in California seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain Alcatel-Lucent patents. Alcatel-Lucent has asserted claims under these patents against computer manufacturers that sell computers with our operating system and application software pre-installed. In February 2007, the jury returned a verdict in Alcatel-Lucent’s favor in the first of a series of patent trials, and awarded $1.5 billion in damages. The trial court has dismissed Alcatel-Lucent’s claims with respect to a second group of patents and two patents in a third grouping. Trial on a newly-consolidated group of all remaining patents is scheduled to begin in February 2008. • In March 2006, Alcatel-Lucent filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court in California, claiming the Xbox 360 violates one of its patents. In response, we asserted counterclaims that Alcatel-Lucent infringes 10 Microsoft patents by its sales of various products. That case has been set for trial in April 2008. • In November 2006, Alcatel-Lucent filed two patent infringement cases against us in U.S. District Court in Texas, asserting IPTV and various networking functionalities violate seven of its patents. In April 2007, we asserted infringement counterclaims based on four of our patents relating to functionality similar to that accused by Alcatel-Lucent. The trial on all of the patents is set for January 2009. • In February 2007, we filed a complaint against Alcatel-Lucent with the International Trade Commission claiming Alcatel-Lucent is infringing four Microsoft patents related to our unified communications technology and seeking to prevent the import of certain Alcatel-Lucent unified communications products into the U.S. This matter has been set for trial in October 2007. • In April 2007, the Multimedia Patent Trust filed a complaint against Microsoft, Dell, and Gateway in San Diego, California accusing the parties of infringing three video-related patents that originally belonged to Alcatel-Lucent. Alcatel-Lucent created the Multimedia Patent Trust prior to the companies’ merger and transferred the patents at issue to the trust. Motions challenging the validity of the trust and Alcatel-Lucent’s transfer of these patents to it will be heard in September 2007. The actual costs to resolve these cases will depend upon many factors such as the outcome of post-trial motions, any appeals, and the results of the remaining trials. In Z4 Technologies, Inc. v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court in Texas in September 2004, the plaintiff alleged that Microsoft Windows and Office product activation functionality violates its patent rights. In April 2006, the jury rendered a $115 million verdict against us. In August 2006, the trial court increased damages by $25 million pursuant to the jury’s finding of willful infringement and awarded Z4 $2 million in attorneys’ fees. We have appealed the verdict. In Veritas Operating Corporation v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington in May 2006, a subsidiary of Symantec filed an action asserting trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and patent infringement relating to certain storage technologies. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this section may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would adversely affect distribution of our operating system or application products. We may enter into material settlements because of these risks. Other. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. PAGE 66 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 As of June 30, 2007, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $800 million in other current liabilities and approximately $800 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. While we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $4.15 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable NOTE 18 SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment revenue and operating income/(loss) was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Revenue: Client $ 14,812 $ 13,040 $ 11,901 Server and Tools 11,182 9,680 8,314 Online Services Business 2,474 2,306 2,353 Microsoft Business Division 16,381 14,516 13,298 Entertainment and Devices Division 6,132 4,808 3,485 Unallocated and other 141 (68 ) 437 Consolidated $ 51,122 $ 44,282 $ 39,788 (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Operating Income/(Loss): Client $ 11,544 $ 10,245 $ 9,435 Server and Tools 3,837 3,171 2,381 Online Services Business (745 ) 115 470 Microsoft Business Division 10,724 9,687 9,146 Entertainment and Devices Division (2,066 ) (1,284 ) (464 ) Reconciling amounts (4,770 ) (5,462 ) (6,407 ) Consolidated $ 18,524 $ 16,472 $ 14,561 SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. In July 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments from seven to five reflecting previously announced reorganizations. Amounts for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 have been recast to conform to the current management view. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our five segments are Client; Server and Tools; Online Services Business; Microsoft Business Division; and Entertainment and Devices Division. PAGE 67 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below: Client – Windows Vista, including Home, Home Premium, Ultimate, Business, and Enterprise Starter Edition; Windows XP Professional and Home; Media Center Edition; Tablet PC Edition; and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools – Windows Server operating system; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Enterprise Services; product support services; Visual Studio; System Center products; Forefront Security products; Biz Talk Server; MSDN; and TechNet, among others. Online Services Business – MSN Search; MapPoint; MSN Internet Access; MSN Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, MSN Bill Pay, and MSN Radio Plus); Windows Live; and MSN Mobile Services. Microsoft Business Division – Microsoft Office; Microsoft Project; Microsoft Visio; Microsoft Office SharePoint Server; Microsoft Exchange Server; Microsoft Exchange Hosted Services; Microsoft Office Live Meeting; Microsoft Office Communication Server; Microsoft Office Communicator; Microsoft Tellme Service; Microsoft Dynamics AX; Microsoft Dynamics CRM; Microsoft Dynamics GP; Microsoft Dynamics NAV; Microsoft Dynamics SL; Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System; Microsoft Partner Program; and Microsoft Office Accounting. Entertainment and Devices Division – Xbox 360 console and games; Xbox Live; Zune; Mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products; Windows Mobile software platform; Windows Embedded device operating system; and Windows Automotive. Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, period-end cut-off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies. PAGE 68 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Significant reconciling items were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2007 2006 2005 Summary of reconciling amounts: Corporate-level activity(1) $ (5,193 ) $ (5,122 ) $ (5,932 ) Stock-based compensation expense 124 (174 ) (1,042 ) Revenue reconciling amounts 119 (68 ) 437 Other 180 (98 ) 130 Total $ (4,770 ) $ (5,462 ) $ (6,407 ) (1) Corporate-level activity excludes stock-based compensation expense and revenue reconciling amounts presented separately in those line items. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2007 revenue.
