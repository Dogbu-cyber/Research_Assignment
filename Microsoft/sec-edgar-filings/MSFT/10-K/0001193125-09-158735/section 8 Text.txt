PAGE 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 3 – Other Income (Expense). Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. A portion of the revenue related to Windows XP is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized PAGE 47 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 ratably on a straight-line basis over the related products’ life cycles. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements. However, Windows Vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program which started June 26, 2009. The program allows customers who purchase PCs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of Windows Vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of Windows 7 at minimal or no cost. In addition, purchasers of retail packaged Windows Vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent Windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available. Accordingly, estimated revenue related to the undelivered Windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (software assurance). In addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions. Revenue related to our Xbox 360 game console, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the retailers. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to drive traffic to our website and/or acquire online advertising space (“traffic acquisitions costs”), costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory valuation adjustments, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility. Capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until PAGE 48 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.3 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Employee Severance We record employee severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Financial Instruments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interests received (securities pledged as collateral) are determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to PAGE 49 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. See Note 5 – Derivatives. Our current financial liabilities, including our short-term debt, have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized discount. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Year Ended June 30, Balance, beginning of period $ 153 $ 117 $ 142 Charged to costs and other 360 88 64 Write-offs (62 ) (52 ) (89 ) Balance, end of period $ 451 $ 153 $ 117 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from July 1 to May 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. We believe the change in our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. We have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively. See Note 10 – Goodwill. PAGE 50 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Intangible Assets Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 10 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate the asset may be impaired. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. Subsequent Events We evaluated events occurring between the end of our most recent fiscal year and July 29, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On April 1, 2009, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Positions (“FSP”) FAS 157-4, FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, and FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1. These FSPs are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities. FSP FAS 157-4 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings versus other comprehensive income. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to interim periods. Adoption of these FSPs did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures. On January 1, 2009, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 requires additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. See Note 5 – Derivatives. On July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. See Note 4 – Investments. SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, became effective for us on July 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit. As of June 30, 2009, we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. This Statement amends Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51, to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for us to July 1, 2009, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except PAGE 51 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We believe the adoption of the delayed items of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. The statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1 which amends SFAS No. 141(R) by establishing a model to account for certain pre-acquisition contingencies. Under the FSP, an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5. SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 are effective for us beginning July 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R)-1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of ARB No. 51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009, and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We believe the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. NOTE 2 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 14,569 $ 17,681 $ 14,065 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 8,945 9,328 9,742 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 51 142 144 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 8,996 9,470 9,886 Earnings per share: Basic (A/B) $ 1.63 $ 1.90 $ 1.44 Diluted (A/C) $ 1.62 $ 1.87 $ 1.42 For the years ended June 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007, 342 million, 91 million, and 199 million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock-based awards and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. PAGE 52 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 3 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) The components of other income (expense) were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Dividends and interest $ 706 $ 888 $ 1,319 Net recognized gains (losses) on investments (125 ) 346 650 Net gains (losses) on derivatives (558 ) 226 (358 ) Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements (509 ) 226 56 Other (56 ) (143 ) (4 ) Total $ (542 ) $ 1,543 $ 1,663 Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. For fiscal year 2009, $509 million of losses were reported as other income (expense). For fiscal years 2008 and 2007, $221 million and $86 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense). Net recognized gains (losses) on investments included other-than-temporary impairments of $862 million, $312 million, and $25 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $1.6 billion and $897 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2009, $751 million and $93 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2008, and $851 million and $176 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2007.

At June 30, 2008, unrealized losses of $255 million consisted of: $121 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $21 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $99 million related to domestic equity securities, and $14 million related to international equity securities. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded was $204 million. At June 30, 2008, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $289 million. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of such foreign exchange contracts was $7.2 billion. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts sold was $3.5 billion. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price PAGE 55 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were immaterial. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their various maturities. The average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns which correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amount of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $2.7 billion and $456 million, respectively. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument under SFAS No. 133 in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage contracts purchased was $1.3 billion. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low cost way of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks while continuing to improve liquidity. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were immaterial. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swap and futures contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they are low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $543 million and $33 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, collateral will be required for posting, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2009, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral is required to be posted.

These amounts include fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk. (b) See Note 6 – Fair Value Measurements. Fair-Value Hedges For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. During fiscal year 2009, we recognized in other income (expense) the following gains (losses) on fair value hedged derivatives and their related hedged items: (In millions) ForeignExchangeContracts EquityContracts Derivatives $121 $191 Hedged items (120 ) (211 ) Total $ 1 $ (20 ) PAGE 57 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Cash-Flow Hedges For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain (loss) is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. During fiscal year 2009, we recognized the following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts: (In millions) Effective portion: Gain recognized in OCI, net of tax effect of $472 $ 876 Gain reclassified from accumulated OCI into revenue $ 884 Amount excluded from effectiveness assessment and ineffective portion: Loss recognized in other income (expense) $ (314 ) We estimate that $528 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2009. Non-Designated Derivatives Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying securities and are recorded as a component of OCI. The amounts recognized during fiscal year 2009 were as follows: (In millions) Foreign exchange contracts $ (234 ) Equity contracts (131 ) Interest-rate contracts 5 Credit contracts (18 ) Commodity contracts (126 ) Total $ (504 ) Gains (losses) for foreign exchange, equity, interest rate, credit, and commodity contracts presented in other income statement line items were immaterial for fiscal year 2009 and have been excluded from the table above. NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own credit risk. In addition to defining fair value, SFAS No. 157 expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is PAGE 58 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. The following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Investments Other Than Derivatives Investments other than derivatives primarily include U.S. Government and Agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, and common and preferred stock. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, exchange-traded mutual funds, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, and certain agency securities. Our Level 3 assets primarily include investments in certain corporate bonds. We value the Level 3 corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs to which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock prices, and volatilities. Unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair values of the investments. Derivatives In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in an active market for identical derivative assets and liabilities that are traded on exchanges. These derivative assets and liabilities are included in Level 1. The fair values for the derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are estimated using industry standard valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes model. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter options, futures, and swap contracts. In certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and we use management judgment to develop assumptions to determine fair value. These derivative assets and liabilities are included in Level 3 and primarily represent derivatives for foreign equities. PAGE 59 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents our assets and liabilities at June 30, 2009, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Gross FairValue FIN No. 39Netting(a) Net FairValue Assets Mutual funds $ 982 $ – $ – $ 982 $ – $ 982 Commercial paper – 2,601 – 2,601 – 2,601 Certificates of deposit – 555 – 555 – 555 U.S. Government and Agency securities 7,134 6,105 – 13,239 – 13,239 Foreign government bonds 501 3,022 – 3,523 – 3,523 Mortgage-backed securities – 3,593 – 3,593 – 3,593 Corporate notes and bonds – 4,073 253 4,326 – 4,326 Municipal securities – 256 – 256 – 256 Common and preferred stock 4,218 28 5 4,251 – 4,251 Derivatives 5 623 5 633 (235 ) 398 Total $12,840 $20,856 $263 $33,959 $(235 ) $33,724 Liabilities Derivatives $ 5 $ 344 $ – $ 349 $(231 ) $ 118 (a) FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts – an interpretation of APB No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105, permits the netting of derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. These amounts include fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk. Changes in Level 3 Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The majority of our Level 3 instruments consist of investment securities classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income. The following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments measured on a recurring basis for the year ended June 30, 2009: (In millions) CorporateNotes andBonds CommonandPreferredStock DerivativeAssets Total Balance, beginning of period $138 $ 8 $ 71 $217 Total realized and unrealized gains (losses): Included in other income (expense) (6 ) (6 ) 51 39 Included in other comprehensive income 111 – – 111 Purchases, issuances, and settlements – 5 (119 ) (114 ) Transfers in (out) 10 (2 ) 2 10 Balance, end of period $253 $ 5 $ 5 $263 Change in unrealized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to assets held as of June 30, 2009 $ (7 ) $ (5 ) $ 4 $ (8 ) PAGE 60 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. At June 30, 2009, the fair value of the common and preferred stock that we held that was required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis was $164 million. This fair value was determined using models with significant unobservable inputs. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, we review the carrying values of our investments when events and circumstances warrant, and we consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary. The fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other than temporary. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, impairment charges of $86 million were recognized for certain investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as the decline in their respective fair values below their cost was determined to be other than temporary in all instances. NOTE 7 INVENTORIES The components of inventories were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2009 2008 Raw materials $170 $417 Work in process 45 31 Finished goods 502 537 Total $717 $985 NOTE 8 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of property and equipment were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2009 2008 Land $ 526 $ 518 Buildings and improvements 5,886 4,302 Leasehold improvements 1,938 1,728 Computer equipment and software 4,989 4,475 Furniture and equipment 1,743 1,521 Total, at cost 15,082 12,544 Accumulated depreciation (7,547 ) (6,302 ) Total, net $ 7,535 $ 6,242 Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements generally range from two to 10 years (representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions), computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. Land is not depreciated. PAGE 61 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 During fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, depreciation expense was $1.7 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. The majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment. NOTE 9 ACQUISITIONS We acquired nine entities during fiscal year 2009 for total consideration of $925 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. All of the entities have been consolidated into our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition dates and are subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair values of assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies within this timeframe will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. NOTE 10 GOODWILL Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 by segment were as follows: (In millions) Balance asof June 30,2007 Acquisitions PurchaseAccountingAdjustmentsand Other Balance asof June 30,2008 Acquisitions PurchaseAccountingAdjustmentsand Other Balance asof June 30,2009 Client $ 77 $ 77 $ (1 ) $ 153 $ 1 $ (77 ) $ 77 Server and Tools 580 90 68 738 233 67 1,038 Online Services Business 552 5,775 (53 ) 6,274 447 (64 ) 6,657 Microsoft Business Division 3,132 1,073 (14 ) 4,191 _ (264 ) 3,927 Entertainment and Devices Division 419 354 (21 ) 752 58 (6 ) 804 Total $4,760 $7,369 $(21 ) $12,108 $739 $(344 ) $12,503 None of the amounts recorded as goodwill are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocations for all of the acquisitions are preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and are subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of the assets and liabilities become available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company within this timeframe will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Changes in goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are included in “purchase accounting adjustments and other” in the above table. We test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, we changed the date of our annual impairment test from July 1 to May 1. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. We believe the change in our annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. We have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively. During fiscal year 2009, the annual impairment test was performed as of July 1, 2008 and was performed again as of May 1, 2009. PAGE 62 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2009 2008 GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization Net CarryingAmount GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization Net CarryingAmount Contract-based $1,087 $ (855 ) $ 232 $1,074 $ (796 ) $ 278 Technology-based 2,033 (1,090 ) 943 1,677 (672 ) 1,005 Marketing-related 188 (97 ) 91 171 (65 ) 106 Customer-related 732 (239 ) 493 708 (124 ) 584 Total $4,040 $(2,281 ) $1,759 $3,630 $(1,657 ) $1,973 During fiscal year 2009 and 2008, we recorded additions to intangible assets of $354 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.

Intangible assets amortization expense was $591 million for fiscal year 2009, $472 million for fiscal year 2008, and $236 million for fiscal year 2007. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets as of June 30, 2009: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, Amount 2010 $ 562 2011 511 2012 455 2013 191 2014 and thereafter 40 Total $1,759 PAGE 63 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 12 DEBT Short-term Debt In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. As of June 30, 2009, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 119 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. In September 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. In November 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. This credit facility expires on November 6, 2009. In March 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. This $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on March 12, 2010. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during the year ended June 30, 2009. Long-term Debt In November 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the September 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. In May 2009, we issued $3.75 billion of debt securities under that registration statement (“Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding. The components of long-term debt as of June 30, 2009 were as follows: (In millions) 2.95% Notes due on June 1, 2014 $ 2,000 4.20% Notes due on June 1, 2019 1,000 5.20% Notes due on June 1, 2039 750 Unamortized debt discount (4 ) Total $ 3,746 Maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, Amount 2010 $ – 2011 – 2012 – 2013 – 2014 2,000 Thereafter 1,750 Total $ 3,750 As of June 30, 2009, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $3.75 billion and $3.74 billion, respectively. The estimate of fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of June 30, 2009. The effective interest yields of the Notes due in 2014, 2019, and 2039 were 3.00%, 4.29%, and 5.22%, respectively, at June 30, 2009. PAGE 64 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Current taxes: U.S. Federal $3,159 $4,357 $4,593 U.S. State and Local 192 256 154 International 1,139 1,007 957 Current taxes 4,490 5,620 5,704 Deferred taxes 762 513 332 Provision for income taxes $5,252 $6,133 $6,036 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 U.S. $ 5,529 $12,682 $12,902 International 14,292 11,132 7,199 Income before income taxes $19,821 $23,814 $20,101 The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and theprovision for income taxes were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (9.3 )% (7.0 )% (5.1 )% Internal Revenue Service settlement – % (5.8 )% – % European Commission fine – % 2.1 % – % Other reconciling items, net 0.8 % 1.5 % 0.1 % Effective rate 26.5 % 25.8 % 30.0 % In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and research credits. In fiscal years 2009 and 2008, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. Other reconciling items in fiscal year 2007 included the impact of a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments. PAGE 65 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2009 2008 Deferred income tax assets: Stock-based compensation expense $ 2,004 $ 2,225 Other expense items 1,595 1,933 Unearned revenue 743 928 Impaired investments 236 331 Other revenue items 120 91 Deferred income tax assets $ 4,698 $ 5,508 Deferred income tax liabilities: International earnings $ (1,191 ) $ (1,300 ) Unrealized gain on investments (516 ) (513 ) Other (499 ) (729 ) Deferred income tax liabilities (2,206 ) (2,542 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 2,492 $ 2,966 Reported as: Current deferred income tax assets $ 2,213 $ 2,017 Long-term deferred income tax assets 279 949 Net deferred income tax assets $ 2,492 $ 2,966 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $18.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the United States. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $5.4 billion. Income taxes paid were $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2009, $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2008, and $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2007. Uncertain Tax Positions As of June 30, 2009, we had $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $4.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of June 30, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. Such interest totaled $230 million in fiscal year 2009 and $121 million in fiscal year 2008. As of June 30, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $554 million and $324 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets. PAGE 66 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 Balance, beginning of year $ 3,195 $ 7,076 Decreases related to settlements (82 ) (4,787 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 2,203 934 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 239 66 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (132 ) (80 ) Reductions due to lapsed statute of limitations (20 ) (14 ) Balance, end of year $ 5,403 $ 3,195 During fiscal year 2008, we reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on its 2000-2003 examination. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $4.8 billion and recognized a tax provision reduction of $1.2 billion. As a result of the 2000-2003 settlement and the related impact on subsequent years, we paid the IRS approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009. We are under audit by the IRS for the tax years 2004-2006. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the United States, none of which are individually material to our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. NOTE 14 UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items: Volume licensing programs Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Undelivered elements Represents the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis and free post-delivery telephone support. This revenue deferral is applicable for Windows XP and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to OEMs, and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems. Undelivered elements include $276 million of deferred revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program. Other Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $475 million, $398 million, and $325 million, in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases in place as of June 30, 2009 are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, Amount 2010 $ 457 2011 370 2012 309 2013 252 2014 and thereafter 997 $ 2,385 PAGE 68 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements. Product Warranty The changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 Balance, beginning of year $ 692 $ 850 Accruals for warranties issued 161 365 Adjustments to pre-existing warranties – 36 Settlements of warranty claims (511 ) (559 ) Balance, end of year $ 342 $ 692 NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES Government Competition Law Matters In March 2004, the European Commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain Windows server protocol technology to our competitors. In March 2007, the European Commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by the March 2004 decision were “not reasonable.” Following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the Commission announced on October 22, 2007 that we were in compliance with the March 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. On February 27, 2008, the Commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (€899 million) relating to the period prior to October 22, 2007. In May 2008, we filed an application with the European Court of First Instance to annul the February 2008 fine. We paid the $1.4 billion (€899 million) fine in June 2008. In January 2008, the Commission opened a competition law investigation relating to the inclusion of various capabilities in our Windows operating system software, including Web browsing software. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint filed with the Commission by Opera Software ASA, a firm that offers Web browsing software. On January 15, 2009, the European Commission issued a statement of objections expressing the Commission’s preliminary view that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Windows since 1996 has violated European competition law. According to the statement of objections, other browsers are foreclosed from competing because Windows includes Internet Explorer. We filed our written response to the statement of objections in late April 2009. The European Commission will not make a final determination until after it assesses our response and considers submissions from others, a process that is now underway. The statement of objections seeks to impose a remedy that is different than the remedy imposed in the earlier proceeding concerning Windows Media Player. While computer users and OEMs are already free to run any Web browsing software on Windows, the Commission is considering ordering other changes to further promote the prospects of competing browser software. This may include ordering creation of a “ballot screen” from which computer users could choose from among a variety of browsers. The statement of objections also seeks to impose a significant fine based on worldwide sales of Windows operating systems. In January 2008, the Commission opened an additional competition law investigation that relates primarily to interoperability with respect to our Microsoft Office family of products. This investigation resulted from complaints filed with the Commission by a trade association of Microsoft’s competitors. On July 24, 2009 we submitted a proposal to the Commission to resolve the investigation concerning Internet Explorer. Under this proposal, European consumers who use Internet Explorer as their default browser would be shown a “ballot screen” from which they could, if they wished, easily install competing browsers from the Web. We also submitted a proposal regarding means PAGE 69 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 of promoting greater interoperability between non-Microsoft products and our Windows and Office families of products. We made this proposal following extensive discussions with the Commission. In a statement issued on July 24, 2009, the Commission stated it welcomes our proposals. We understand the Commission will now consider them, which will likely entail seeking input from a range of industry participants. We are subject to a Consent Decree and Final Judgment (“Final Judgments”) that resolved lawsuits brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in two separate actions. The Final Judgments imposed various constraints on our Windows operating system businesses. Originally, the Final Judgments were scheduled to expire in November 2007. In 2006, we voluntarily agreed to extend certain elements of the Final Judgments to November 2009. The U.S. Department of Justice and other states advised the Court that they would not seek any extension of the Final Judgments to which they are party. In January 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states’ motion to extend these additional provisions of the Final Judgments until November 2009. On April 16, 2009, we agreed with the Department of Justice and the states, respectively, to extend the Final Judgments to May 2011, and submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia joint motions for this extension. In April 2009, the Court entered an order approving the extension. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software products. We obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. Courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. We have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. The settlements in all states except Arizona have received final court approval. Cases in Canada have not been settled. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of the overcharge class action cases will range between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. The actual cost depends on factors such as the claim rate, the quantity and mix of products for which claims are made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. At June 30, 2009, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $800 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.8 billion less payments made to date of approximately $1.0 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses. Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims In November 2004, Novell, Inc. filed a complaint in U.S. District Court, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. This case was transferred to Maryland. In June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of nine claims of the complaint. Both parties appealed, and in October 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. Fact discovery has closed and summary judgment motions are expected to be filed in the fall. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims In 2003 we filed an action in U.S. District Court in California seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe certain Alcatel-Lucent patents (although this action began before the merger of Alcatel and Lucent in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of Alcatel-Lucent). In April 2008, a jury returned a verdict in Alcatel-Lucent’s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of one video and three user interface patents. The jury concluded that we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367 million in damages. In June 2008, the trial judge increased the amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of interest. We have appealed that award to the Federal Circuit. In December 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation PAGE 70 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 pending between Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent, leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. In April 2009, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, after a reexamination of the remaining patent in dispute, determined that the patent was invalid and Alcatel-Lucent has appealed that ruling. In October 2003, Uniloc USA Inc., a subsidiary of a Singapore-based security technology company, filed a patent infringement suit in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, claiming that product activation technology in Windows XP and certain other Microsoft programs violated a Uniloc patent. After we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded the case for trial. In April 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. We are seeking to overturn this verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, will appeal, based on evidence that our product activation technology does not infringe the patent, that the patent is invalid, and that the damages were unsupported. With pre-judgment interest, approximately $500 million is in dispute. In March 2007, i4i Limited Partnership, based in Canada, sued Microsoft in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, claiming that certain custom XML technology in Word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4i’s patent. In May 2009, a jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we willfully infringed the patent. Our defense of inequitable conduct has not yet been ruled upon, and we are also seeking to overturn the verdict via post-trial motions and, if necessary, via appeal. With pre-judgment interest, approximately $240 million is in dispute. There are over 50 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft, 10 of which are set for trial in fiscal year 2010. Other We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2009, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $800 million in other current liabilities and approximately $400 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. While we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $2.2 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. The foregoing amount does not include the January 15, 2009 European Commission statement of objections, the outcome and range of which is not reasonably estimable. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

Employees purchased the following shares: (Shares in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Year Ended June 30, Shares purchased 24 18 17 Average price per share $ 20.13 $ 26.78 $ 25.36 At June 30, 2009, 83 million shares were reserved for future issuance. Savings Plan We have a savings plan in the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $262 million, $238 million, and $218 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. Stock Plans We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. At June 30, 2009, an aggregate of 714 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises. Stock Awards Stock awards (“SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Our SAs generally vest over a five-year period. Shared Performance Stock Awards Shared performance stock awards (“SPSAs”) are a form of SA in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. The Company granted SPSAs for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007 with performance periods of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009, July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008, and July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007, respectively. At the end of each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. An additional number of shares, approximately 12.2% of the total target SPSAs, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant date. Following the end of the fiscal year 2008 and 2007 performance periods, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the number of shares of SPSAs to be issued were 18 million and 11 million respectively, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. The number of shares of SPSAs to be issued for the fiscal year 2009 performance period will be determined in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. PAGE 74 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Executive Officer Incentive Plan In fiscal year 2009, the Compensation Committee approved a new Executive Officer Incentive Plan (“EOIP”) for executive officers of the Company. The EOIP replaced the annual cash bonus opportunity and equity award plans for executive officers. Under the EOIP, the Compensation Committee makes awards of performance-based compensation for specified performance periods. For fiscal year 2009, executive officers were eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and SAs from an incentive pool funded based on the achievement of operating income targets. Following approval of the awards for fiscal year 2009, 20% of the award will be paid to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% will be converted into an SA for shares of Microsoft common stock. The SA portion of the award will vest one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year 2009, and one-quarter on August 31 of each of the following three years. The Company will grant awards to the executive officers in September 2009 based on the performance period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009, from an incentive pool equal to 0.35% of the Company’s fiscal year 2009 operating income. Each executive officer will receive a fixed percentage of the pool ranging between 0 and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer’s performance during fiscal year 2009. The number of shares subject to the SA portion of the award will be determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price of Microsoft common stock on August 31, 2009. Activity for All Stock Plans We measure the fair value of SAs and SPSAs based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. SAs and SPSAs EOIP are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. The fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: 2009 2008 2007 Year Ended June 30, Dividends per share (quarterly amounts) $ 0.11 - $0.13 $ 0.10 - $0.11 $ 0.09 - $0.10 Interest rates range 1.4% - 3.6% 2.5% - 4.9% 4.3% -5.3% During fiscal year 2009, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Shares(In millions) WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value Stock awards: Nonvested balance, beginning of year 153 $ 26.12 Granted 91 $ 24.95 Vested (43 ) $ 25.56 Forfeited (10 ) $ 26.08 Nonvested balance, end of year 191 $ 25.69 Shared performance stock awards: Nonvested balance, beginning of year 36 $ 26.14 Granted 10 $ 25.93 Vested (18 ) $ 25.07 Forfeited – – Nonvested balance, end of year 28 $ 26.79 As of June 30, 2009, there was $3.8 billion and $551 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively. PAGE 75 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 During fiscal year 2008 and 2007, the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions, except fair values) 2008 2007 Stock awards granted 71 57 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 27.83 $ 25.15 Shared performance stock awards granted 19 11 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 27.82 $ 25.18 Stock Options In fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees SAs rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. Since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. Nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan until 2004 when we began granting directors SAs. Nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to certain officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. We granted one million, 10 million, and two million stock options, respectively, in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007. Employee stock options outstanding were as follows: Shares(In millions) WeightedAverageExercise Price WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm (Years) AggregateIntrinsicValue(In millions) Balance, July 1, 2008 364 $28.12 Granted 1 $ 2.14 Exercised (6 ) $22.44 Canceled (28 ) $30.31 Forfeited (1 ) $10.50 Balance, June 30, 2009 330 $27.99 1.99 $318 Exercisable, June 30, 2009 327 $27.99 1.98 $271 Options outstanding as of June 30, 2009 include approximately eight million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. While these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise price. These options have an exercise price range of $0.01 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $9.50. During fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 48 $ 1,042 $ 818 Total fair value of stock awards vested $ 1,126 $ 804 $ 566 Total fair value of shared performance stock awards vested $ 450 $ 336 $ 292 Cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $88 million and $12 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2009. PAGE 76 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 21 EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of this program, we announced the elimination of up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount which was recorded as corporate-level activity. During the year we had a net reduction of approximately 4,400 positions under the resource management program. The changes in our employee severance liabilities were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 Balance, beginning of period $ – Employee severance charges 330 Cash payments (203 ) Balance, end of period $ 127 NOTE 22 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA Segment revenue and operating income (loss) was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Revenue: Client $ 14,414 $ 16,472 $ 14,779 Server and Tools 14,135 13,121 11,117 Online Services Business 3,088 3,190 2,434 Microsoft Business Division 18,902 18,935 16,478 Entertainment and Devices Division 7,753 8,213 6,136 Unallocated and other 145 489 178 Consolidated $ 58,437 $ 60,420 $ 51,122 (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 Operating Income (Loss): Client $ 10,435 $ 12,566 $ 11,295 Server and Tools 5,047 4,170 3,520 Online Services Business (2,391 ) (1,304 ) (617 ) Microsoft Business Division 11,940 12,169 10,757 Entertainment and Devices Division 5 325 (1,945 ) Reconciling amounts (4,673 ) (5,655 ) (4,572 ) Consolidated $ 20,363 $ 22,271 $ 18,438 PAGE 77 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income (loss) based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current management view. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our five segments are Client; Server and Tools; Online Services Business; Microsoft Business Division; and Entertainment and Devices Division. The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below: Client – Windows Vista, including Home Basic, Home Premium, Ultimate, Business, Enterprise and Starter Edition; Windows XP, including Professional, Home, Media Center, and Tablet PC Edition; and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools – Windows Server operating system; Microsoft SQL Server; Visual Studio; Silverlight; System Center products; Forefront security products; Biz Talk Server; Microsoft Consulting Services; Premier product support services; and other products and services. Online Services Business – Bing; Microsoft adCenter/adExpert; Microsoft Media Network (MMN); MSN portals, channels, and mobile services; Windows Live suite of applications and mobile services; Atlas online tools for advertisers and publishers; MSN Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, and MSN Software Services); and Razorfish media agency services. Microsoft Business Division – Microsoft Office; Microsoft Office Project; Microsoft Office Visio; Microsoft Office SharePoint Server; FAST ESP; Microsoft Exchange Server; Microsoft Exchange Hosted Services; Microsoft Office Live Meeting; Microsoft Office Communications Server; Microsoft Office Communicator; Microsoft Tellme Service; Microsoft Dynamics ERP products including AX, NAV, GP, SL, Retail Management System, and Point of Sale; Microsoft Dynamics CRM; and Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online. Entertainment and Devices Division – Xbox 360 console and games; Xbox Live; Zune; Mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products (such as mice and keyboards); Windows Mobile software and services platform; Windows Embedded device operating system; Windows Automotive; and the Microsoft Surface computing platform. Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.

NOTE 24 SUBSEQUENT EVENT On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a 10-year agreement under which Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! Web sites. As part of the transaction, Microsoft will compensate Yahoo! through a revenue sharing agreement on traffic generated on the Yahoo! network owned and operated sites, and a guarantee of search revenue in certain countries. Additionally, Yahoo! will become the exclusive worldwide relationship sales force for both companies’ premium search advertisers. Self-serve advertising for both companies will be fulfilled by Microsoft’s adCenter platform, and prices for all search ads will continue to be set by adCenter’s automated auction process. Microsoft will also acquire an exclusive 10-year license to Yahoo!’s core search technology and will have the ability to integrate Yahoo! search technology into its existing Web search platform. The agreement does not cover either company’s Web properties and products, email, instant messaging, display advertising, or any other aspect of the companies’ businesses, and the companies will continue to compete in those areas. The transaction will be subject to regulatory review. The agreement entered into on July 29 anticipates that the parties will enter into more detailed definitive agreements prior to closing the transaction. The companies are hopeful that closing can occur in early calendar year 2010. PAGE 80 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements, on July 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 29, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 29, 2009 PAGE 81 Table of Contents Part II
