PAGE 44 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped, with a portion of the revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (currently named Software Assurance and, previously named Upgrade Advantage). In addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions. PAGE 45 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Revenue related to our Xbox game console is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Revenue for fixed price services arrangements is recognized based on percentage of completion. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, PC games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. SALES AND MARKETING Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.06 billion in fiscal year 2003, $904 million in fiscal year 2004, and $995 million in fiscal year 2005. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments include both debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. We lend certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment income. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. The fair value of collateral that we are permitted to sell or re-pledge was $499 million at both June 30, 2004 and 2005. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. PAGE 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equities price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. For options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Equities Price Risk. Equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. We determine the security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are also used to manage equity exposures. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. We use exchange-traded option and future contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, to hedge interest rate risk. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. In addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. To Be Announced (TBAs) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets are not taken at the earliest available delivery date. All derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change. PAGE 47 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Balance atbeginning of period Charged to costs and expenses Write-offs and other Balance at end of period 2003 $ 209 $ 118 $ (85 ) $ 242 2004 242 44 (120 ) 166 2005 166 48 (43 ) 171 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less. GOODWILL Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain previous year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, including the reclassification of auction rate securities (ARS) as short-term investments instead of cash and equivalents in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and reclassification of non-current tax contingencies from non-current deferred taxes to other non-current liabilities. We reclassified $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion of investments in ARS as of June 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively, that were previously included in cash and equivalents to short-term investments. We have included purchases and sales of ARS in our statements of cash flows as a component of investing activities. To conform to our current year presentation we have also reclassified $2.0 billion in our fiscal year 2004 balance sheet from net long-term deferred income taxes to other long-term liabilities, with conforming reclassifications in the statement of cash flows. These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations or changes in stockholders’ equity, or cash flows. In addition, net losses on equity investees and other for previous periods were reclassified to investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation. PAGE 48 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTE 2 UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items: Volume licensing programs – Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Undelivered elements – Represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Other – Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Business Solutions maintenance and enhancement billings, Xbox Live and other billings that are accounted for as subscriptions, and other agreements where Microsoft is committed to the delivery of future enhancements, products, or services, including the TV platform.

Unrealized losses from fixed income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Of the unrealized losses of $293 million at PAGE 50 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 June 30, 2004, $51 million exceeded twelve months. At June 30, 2005 unrealized losses of $258 million consisted of: $112 million related to investment grade fixed income securities, $13 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed income securities, $90 million related to domestic equity securities and $43 million related to international equity securities. Unrealized losses from fixed income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Of the unrealized losses of $258 million at June 30, 2005, $25 million exceeded twelve months. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2005. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2004 the recorded basis of these investments was $1.65 billion, and their estimated fair value was $2.12 billion. At June 30, 2005 the recorded basis of these investments was $1.05 billion, and their estimated fair value was $1.27 billion. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. The maturities of debt securities at June 30, 2005 were as follows: (In millions) Cost basis Estimated fairvalue Due in one year or less $ 6,648 $ 6,647 Due after one year through five years 16,972 16,960 Due after five years through ten years 7,584 7,771 Due after ten years 3,259 3,307 Total $ 34,463 $ 34,685 Debt securities include fixed maturity securities. NOTE 4 INVESTMENT INCOME AND OTHER The components of investment income and other are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2003 2004 2005 Dividends and interest $ 1,957 $ 1,892 $ 1,460 Net gains on investments 44 1,563 856 Net losses on derivatives (424 ) (268 ) (262 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other (68 ) (25 ) 13 Investment income and other $ 1,509 $ 3,162 $ 2,067 Net gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2003, $82 million in fiscal year 2004, and $152 million in fiscal year 2005. Realized gains and (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $1.44 billion and $(245) million in fiscal year 2003, $2.16 billion and $(518) million in fiscal year 2004, and $1.38 billion and $(376) million in fiscal year 2005. NOTE 5 DERIVATIVES For derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 133, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. During fiscal year 2003, $74 million in losses on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $229 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2004, $31 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $325 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the PAGE 51 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $79 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $116 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During fiscal year 2003, $40 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $2 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. During fiscal year 2004, $14 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and no derivative gains or losses were reclassified to investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $57 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $33 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. We estimate that $42 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. No significant fair value hedges or cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.

Our annual testing resulted in no impairment charges to goodwill in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, we had no material acquisitions.

Microsoft. During fiscal year 2005, we recorded additions to finite-lived intangible assets of approximately $90 million. No other material intangibles were acquired in fiscal year 2004. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our finite-lived intangible assets.

We have not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $4.1 billion of our undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, all of which relate to fiscal 2002 through 2005 earnings, because these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was enacted in October 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. Based on our current understanding of the Act and subsequent guidance published by the U.S. Treasury, we have determined that we are eligible and intend to repatriate approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction. Accordingly, we recorded a corresponding tax provision benefit of $179 million from the reversal of previously provided U.S. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings. We intend to pay this dividend in fiscal year 2006. Income taxes paid were $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2003, $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2004, and $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2005. Tax Contingencies. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed and closed its audits of our consolidated federal income tax returns through 1996. We recently entered into a closing agreement with the IRS for tax years 1997 through 1999 resulting in certain adjustments to our federal income tax liability for those years. Accordingly, our fiscal year 2005 tax provision has been reduced by $776 million as a result of reversing previously established reserves in excess of the additional tax liability assessed by the IRS for the 1997-1999 tax years. The IRS is currently conducting an audit of our consolidated federal income tax return for tax years 2000 through 2003. Although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions, the non-current portion of which is included in other long-term liabilities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter, which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing, tax benefits from the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extra Territorial Income tax rules and the amount of research and experimentation tax credits claimed. Although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain; therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. Based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. Due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded.

The options transferred to JPMorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm’s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. As of June 30, 2005, the options have strike prices ranging from $28.83 to $89.58 per share and have expiration dates between December 2005 and December 2006. On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion of Microsoft common stock over the succeeding four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders’ equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. Our Board of Directors had previously approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our stock option and stock purchase plans. Under these repurchase plans, we have made the following share repurchases: (share amounts in millions, dollars in billions)(1) Fiscal year 2003 2004 2005(1) Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount First quarter 120.6 $ 3.0 43.3 $ 1.2 22.8 $ 0.6 Second quarter 38.8 1.0 30.5 0.8 23.6 0.7 Third quarter 30.7 0.7 49.9 1.4 95.1 2.4 Fourth quarter 48.1 1.2 – – 170.7 4.3 Total 238.2 $ 5.9 123.7 $ 3.4 312.2 $ 8.0 (1) All amounts repurchased in fiscal year 2005 were repurchased under the repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004. In addition, as part of our authorized stock repurchase program, we have purchased call options on 25 million shares of our common stock with strike prices ranging from $27.00 – $27.50. The call options have maturities ranging from July 15, 2005 to January 20, 2006 and are reflected in stockholders’ equity. In fiscal year 2005, our Board of Directors approved the following dividends: Approval Date Per ShareDividend Date of Record Total Amount (in millions) Payment Date July 20, 2004 $ 0.08 August 25, 2004 $ 870 September 14, 2004 July 20, 2004 $ 3.00 November 17, 2004 $ 32,640 December 2, 2004 September 15, 2004 $ 0.08 November 17, 2004 $ 871 December 2, 2004 December 8, 2004 $ 0.08 February 17, 2005 $ 868 March 10, 2005 March 23, 2005 $ 0.08 May 18, 2005 $ 860 June 9, 2005 June 15, 2005 $ 0.08 August 17,2005 (1) September 8, 2005 (1) The dividend approved on June 15, 2005 will be paid after the filing date of this report on Form 10-K.

Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. In connection with the use of the retroactive restatement method, income statement amounts were restated for fiscal year 2003 to reflect results as if the fair-value method of SFAS No. 123 had been applied from its original effective date. Total compensation cost recognized in income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $3.75 billion in fiscal year 2003, $5.73 billion in fiscal year 2004, and $2.45 billion in fiscal year 2005. The amounts for fiscal year 2004 include $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) due to the completion of the employee stock option transfer program. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. The administrative committee under the plan approved a change to the common stock purchase discount and approved PAGE 58 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 the elimination of the related look back period and a change to quarterly purchase periods that became effective July 1, 2005. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock may presently be purchased by employees at three months intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal year 2005 employees purchased 16.4 million shares at an average price of $23.33 per share. At June 30, 2005, 159.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance. Under the plan in effect previous to fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock could be purchased at six month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month period. Employees could purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal year 2003 and 2004 employees purchased 15.2 million and 16.7 million shares at average prices of $22.56, and $22.74 per share. Savings Plan. We have a savings plan in the United States, that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $118 million, $141 million, and $154 million in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. Stock Plans. In fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (“eligible options”) to JPMorgan. The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. Under the terms of the program, JPMorgan paid us $382 million for the 345 million options transferred. We made an initial payment of $219 million to participating employees for the transferred options, with a remaining portion to be paid in one or more payments that are subject to participating employees’ continued employment over the two or three years following the transfer. The options that were transferred to JPMorgan resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. The contingent payments applicable to eligible options that are subject to continued employment of participating employees will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the contingent payments. The stock option transfer program also resulted in a decrease to our long-term deferred tax assets due to the excess of recorded compensation expense for these options over the related tax deduction reported on our tax return. For fiscal year 2004, deferred tax assets were reduced by approximately $2.01 billion with an offsetting reduction in paid-in capital, reflecting the reduction of previously recorded deductions reported on our tax return in excess of stock based compensation expense. A description of our stock plans follows. We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants and advisors. The plans provide for awards of stock options and stock awards. At June 30, 2005, an aggregate of 816 million shares were available for future grant under our stock plans. Our plans under which awards may be issued do not contain separate limitations on the number of stock awards; all 816 million shares remaining available for grant at June 30, 2005 could be awarded as stock awards. In addition, awards that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. The options transferred to JPMorgan have been removed from our plans; any options transferred to JPMorgan that expire without being exercised will not become available for grant under any of our plans. On November 9, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our Board of Directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. Additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. PAGE 59 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. Stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. As a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on December 2, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96 million options and 6.7 million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. In addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 3.5 million shares. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards. Stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. Our stock awards generally vest ratably over a five-year period. Shared Performance Stock Awards are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our performance against specified performance targets. The performance period is July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 (January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 for certain executive officers). At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock and stock awards issued will be determined by adjusting upward or downward from the target in a range between 33% and 150% (0% to 150% for certain executive officers). The final performance percentage on which the payout will be based, considering performance metrics established for the performance period, will be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee of the board in its sole discretion. Shares of stock will be issued following the end of the performance period and as the stock awards vest ratably over the following two years. Because these awards cover a three-year period, Shared Performance Stock Awards will only be awarded in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive Shared Performance Stock Awards. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards are amortized over the vesting period (generally 5 years) using the straight line method. The following activity has occurred under our existing plans: (share amounts in millions) Year Ended June 30 2004 2005 Stock awards Beginning balance 3.9 34.4 Granted 32.6 41.0 Special dividend adjustment – 6.7 Vested (.8 ) (7.3 ) Cancelled (1.3 ) (3.5 ) Ending balance 34.4 71.3 Weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the year* $ 24.09 $ 24.03 Shared performance stock awards Beginning balance – 30.5 Granted 31.7 3.7 Special dividend adjustment – 3.5 Vested – – Cancelled (1.2 ) (2.4 ) Ending balance 30.5 35.3 Weighted-average fair value per share for shares granted during the year* $ 23.62 $ 24.35 * Adjusted for additional awards granted for the $3.00 special dividend. Stock Options. Nonqualified stock options have been granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plans. Nonqualified and incentive stock options have been granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted before 1995 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. At June 30, 2005, stock options for 662 million shares were vested. PAGE 60 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The weighted average Black-Scholes value of options granted under the stock plans during fiscal year 2003 and 2004 was $12.08 and $10.13, respectively. No stock options were granted in fiscal 2005. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants: Year Ended June 30 2003 2004 Weighted average expected life in years 7 7 Dividend per share $ 0.08 $ 0.16 Volatility 42.0 % 29.5 % Risk-free interest rate 3.9 % 4.1 % Employee stock options outstanding are as follows: (In millions, except per share amounts) Price per Share Shares Range Weightedaverage Balance, June 30, 2002 1,604 $ 0.40 – $59.57 $ 26.88 Granted 254 21.42 – 29.12 24.27 Exercised (234 ) 0.51 – 28.22 6.89 Canceled/Forfeited (75 ) 2.13 – 59.56 34.33 Balance, June 30, 2003 1,549 $ 0.40 – $59.56 $ 29.30 Granted 2 25.46 – 29.96 26.76 Exercised (198 ) 0.51 – 29.38 12.21 Stock Option Transfer Program (345 ) 33.03 – 59.56 38.70 Canceled/Forfeited (59 ) 2.31 – 58.28 31.29 Balance, June 30, 2004 949 $ 0.40 – $59.56 $ 29.26 Special Dividend Adjustment 96 0.36 – 53.61 26.68 Granted – – – Exercised (138 ) 3.39 – 29.56 20.42 Canceled/Forfeited (43 ) 14.29 – 58.28 28.89 Balance, June 30, 2005 864 $ 0.36 – $59.56 $ 27.41 For various price ranges, weighted average characteristics of outstanding employee stock options at June 30, 2005 are as follows: (In millions, except per share amounts and years) Outstanding options Exercisable options Range of exercise prices Shares Remaininglife (years) Weightedaverage price Shares Weightedaverage price $ 0.36 – $15.00 24 1.5 $ 8.81 24 $ 8.81 15.01 – 25.00 276 6.56 $ 22.15 136 $ 22.31 25.01 – 33.00 430 4.64 $ 27.88 369 $ 28.10 33.01 – 41.00 125 3.22 $ 39.42 124 $ 39.43 41.01 – 59.56 9 2.58 $ 44.78 9 $ 44.78 864 662 As of June 30, 2005, 345 million transferred options to JP Morgan remained outstanding and are excluded from the amounts noted as employee options outstanding in the tables above. See Note 12. In addition, the tables above include in the total options outstanding 4.3 million options outstanding that were granted in conjunction with PAGE 61 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 corporate acquisitions. These options are included in the option totals; however, they are excluded from the exercise price ranges presented. These options had an exercise price range of $0.00 to $170.87 and a weighted average exercise price of $13.68. NOTE 15 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30 2003 2004 2005 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 7,531 $ 8,168 $ 12,254 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 10,723 10,803 10,839 Dilutive effect of employee stock options and awards 159 91 67 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 10,882 10,894 10,906 Earnings per share: Basic (A/B) $ 0.70 $ 0.76 $ 1.13 Diluted (A/C) $ 0.69 $ 0.75 $ 1.12 For the years ended June 30, 2003, 2004, and 2005, 1.09 billion, 1.2 billion and 854 million shares attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2005, 25.24 million shared performance stock awards, out of the 35.3 million targeted amount outstanding, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in Note 14 – Employee Stock and Savings Plans. NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $290 million, $331 million, and $299 million in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Amount 2006 $ 230 2007 204 2008 167 2009 122 2010 and thereafter 310 $1,033 We have committed $152 million for constructing new buildings. As of June 30, 2004, we had guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company. The total amount of these guarantees was approximately $51 million. Effective December 21, 2004, the unconditional guarantees were terminated. PAGE 62 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists. We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we can not estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Our product warranty accrual reflects management’s best estimate of our probable liability under its product warranties (primarily relating to the Xbox console). We determine the warranty accrual based on known product failures (if any), historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Our warranty accrual totals $14 million as of June 30, 2005. There has been no significant activity impacting the results of operations for any period presented. NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES Government competition law matters. On March 25, 2004, the European Commission announced a decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft. The Commission concluded that we infringed European competition law by refusing to provide our competitors with licenses to certain protocol technology in the Windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback functionality in Windows desktop operating systems. The Commission ordered us to make the relevant licenses to our technology available to our competitors and to develop and make available a version of the Windows desktop operating system that does not include specified software relating to media playback. The decision also imposed a fine of €497 million, which resulted in a charge in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 of €497 million ($605 million). We filed an appeal of the decision to the Court of First Instance on June 6, 2004. On December 22, 2004, the Court ordered that we must comply with the decision pending review on appeal and we are taking steps to ensure we are in compliance. The hearing date for the appeal is expected to be determined later in calendar year 2005. We continue to contest the conclusion that European competition law was infringed and will defend our position vigorously. The Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) is investigating whether we have violated Korean competition law by including Windows Media Player technologies in Windows, by including Windows Messenger in Windows, or by distributing Windows Media Services as an optional component of Windows Server. Hearings on this issue before the KFTC began on July 13, 2005, continued on August 23, 2005, and may be extended into the fall of 2005. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state Attorneys General have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. Antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class action lawsuits. A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain software applications products. The federal cases have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. These cases allege that we competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover alleged overcharges for these products. To date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages in cases brought against us by indirect purchasers under federal law and in 17 states. Nine of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. Appeals of one of those state rulings is pending. There was no appeal in four states. Claims under federal law brought on behalf of foreign purchasers have been dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Maryland as have all claims brought on behalf of consumers seeking injunctive relief under federal law. The ruling on the injunctive relief and the ruling dismissing the federal claims of indirect purchasers are currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, as is a ruling denying certification of certain proposed classes of U.S. direct purchasers. Courts in eleven states have ruled that indirect PAGE 63 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 purchaser cases may proceed as class actions, while courts in two states have denied class certification. In 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the California plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. Under the proposed settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers that entitle the class members to be reimbursed up to the face value of their vouchers for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers issued will depend on the number of class members who make a claim and are issued vouchers. Two-thirds of the value of vouchers unissued or unredeemed by class members will be made available to certain schools in California in the form of vouchers that also may be redeemed for cash against purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware, software, and related services. Since the beginning of 2003, we also reached similar agreements to settle all claims in a number of other states. The proposed settlements in these states are structured similarly to the California settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the value of vouchers unissued to class members will be made available to certain schools in the relevant states. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued in these settlements, including the California settlement, is approximately $1.9 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools who are issued and redeem vouchers. The settlements in Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia have received final court approval. The proposed settlement in Nebraska has received preliminary approval by the court in those states, but still requires final approval. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Interpretation (FIN) 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, at June 30, 2005, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.1 billion, net of payments to date for administrative expenses and legal fees. Other antitrust litigation and claims. On August 27, 2004, the City and County of San Francisco, the City of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, San Mateo, Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties filed a putative class action against us in San Francisco Superior Court. The action was brought on behalf of all governmental entities, agencies and political subdivisions of the State of California who indirectly purchased our operating system or word processing and spreadsheet software during the period from February 18, 1995 to the date of trial in the action. The plaintiffs seek treble damages under California’s Cartwright Act and disgorgement of unlawful profits under its Unfair Competition Act resulting from our alleged combinations to restrain trade, deny competition, and monopolize the world markets for PC operating systems and word processing and spreadsheet applications (and productivity suites including these applications). We were served with the complaint on August 30, 2004 and we removed the case to the U.S. District Court for Maryland. Our motion to dismiss the complaint was granted in its entirety on April 18, 2005 with leave to file an amended complaint alleging claims under the Cartwright Act based on conduct within the four-year statute of limitation the court ruled applies to the plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs also may seek to appeal the court’s decision. On December 18, 2003, RealNetworks, Inc. filed suit against us alleging violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws. The alleged violations relate to streaming media features of Windows and related technologies. RealNetworks seeks damages and injunctive relief, including a permanent injunction requiring us to offer a version of Windows products with no streaming media features. We deny the allegations and will vigorously defend the action. RealNetworks filed the case in federal court in San Jose, California. It has been consolidated for pretrial purposes with other cases pending in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. On November 12, 2004, Novell, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for in Utah asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. On June 10, 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. The remaining two claims were not dismissed and litigation has proceeded on those claims. We are seeking leave to appeal the decision not to dismiss those claims. In addition, we have been notified of additional antitrust damage claims by several competitors and several licensees of our products. On July 1, 2005, we announced a settlement with IBM resolving claims asserted by IBM that arose from the circumstances of United States v. Microsoft and findings of fact that identified IBM as having been impacted in its business by practices on which the U. S. District Court ruled against us, and claims related to IBM’s OS/2 and SmartSuite businesses. Under the agreement, we paid IBM $775 million and extended a $75 million credit for IBM’s internal deployment of our software. IBM released all antitrust claims against us based on past conduct except for PAGE 64 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 claims related to its server business as to which IBM will not sue us for at least two years. The costs related to this settlement were accrued in other current liabilities as of June 30, 2005. In addition to the IBM matter, as of June 30, 2005, we have recorded a liability of $455 million for the foregoing other antitrust lawsuits and claims. While we intend to vigorously defend those matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes which we estimate could be up to $400 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. Patent cases. We are a defendant in more than 35 patent infringement cases that we are defending vigorously. In the case of Eolas Technologies, Inc. and University of California v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 2, 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of Windows. On August 11, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs’ patent was issued through September 2001. The plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from September 2001 to the present. On January 14, 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, including post-trial interest of $45 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. We appealed and on March 2, 2005 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, ruling that the trial court had erred in excluding certain previous art evidence and ruling as a matter of law on other evidence. The appellate court also reversed the trial court’s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to reveal material previous art while obtaining the patent. In October 2003, the U.S. Patent Office initiated a Director-ordered re-examination of the Eolas patent. On February 26, 2004, the Patent Office issued an Office Action rejecting the claims of the Eolas patent. We believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. The actual costs are dependent upon many unknown factors such as the events of a retrial of the plaintiff’s claims. In Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on December 21, 2001, the plaintiff has asserted two patents related to half-toning, which it believes are infringed by certain printing functionality allegedly present in different versions of Windows. Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount of damages in the form of “reasonable royalties” on Microsoft’s Windows products. Microsoft’s defense based on the plaintiff’s inequitable conduct was tried on August 11 and 12, 2005. The remaining issues in the case may be scheduled for trial in the second half of calendar year 2005. In TVI v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on May 16, 2002, the plaintiff alleges infringement by the Autoplay feature of Windows. The case is scheduled for trial in the second half of 2005. In Microsoft v. Lucent, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Diego on April 8, 2003, we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe any valid patent among a number of patents Lucent has been asserting against computer manufacturers who sell computers with Microsoft software pre-installed. No trial date has been set. In Arendi USA, Inc. and Arendi Holding Limited v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on July 31, 2002, the plaintiffs alleged infringement of one patent by certain Smart Tags features in Microsoft Office XP and Office 2003. Following trial in September 2004 the jury returned a verdict for us, finding that we did not infringe the patents. The plaintiffs have appealed. In Amado v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on March 7, 2003, the plaintiff has accused the link table functionality available in Microsoft Access when used with Microsoft Excel. After a jury trial, we were found to infringe one claim of the patent and damages were awarded in the amount of $8.9 million. The judge later found for us on its defense of laches, which reduced the damages award to $5.9 million. The court also imposed an injunction against further distribution of the accused feature as part of Microsoft Access, but stayed the injunction pending appellate review. We have appealed. In BTG v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on July 2, 2004, the plaintiff has accused our Windows and Office products of infringing several patents. The patents are directed to “update” technology, active desktop concepts and off-line browsing. No trial date has been set. In AVG v. Microsoft, the plaintiff filed a number of cases in the Eastern District of Texas against us, our major OEMs, other computer game console makers (Sony and Nintendo), and computer game publishers on August 23, 2004. The case concerns graphics functionality in Windows and Xbox. The first case against us is scheduled for trial in January 2006. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending patent cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, adversely affecting distribution of our operating system or application products. The risks associated with an adverse decision may result in material settlements. Other. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, these matters are subject to PAGE 65 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 inherent uncertainties and management’s view of them may change in the future. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. As of June 30, 2005, we had accrued liabilities totaling $1.7 billion in other current liabilities and $961 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the above matters.

This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below: Client – Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools – Server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other server products. Also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. PAGE 66 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Information Worker – Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, an allocation for Server CALs, and professional product support services. Microsoft Business Solutions – Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Retail Management System, Microsoft Point of Sale and other business applications and services including the Microsoft Partner Program. Microsoft Business Solutions also develops Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting and Business Contact Manager for Outlook, which are marketed by Information Worker. MSN – Personal communication services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels, and online paid services including MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services, and MSN Mobile service. Mobile and Embedded Devices – Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. Home and Entertainment – Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, mice, keyboards, Mac Office, and TV platform products. Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, quarter end cut off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies. Significant reconciling items are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2003 2004 2005 Operating income reconciling amounts: Legal settlements and contingent liabilities $ (1,079 ) $ (2,832 ) $ (2,312 ) Stock-based compensation expense (3,749 ) (4,516 ) (1,042 ) Revenue reconciling amounts (508 ) 344 325 Corporate-level expenses(1) (1,980 ) (3,037 ) (3,405 ) Other 803 410 167 Total $ (6,513 ) $ (9,631 ) $ (6,267 ) (1) Corporate-level expenses exclude legal settlements and contingent liabilities, stock-based compensation expense, and revenue reconciling amounts presented separately in those line items. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10% of total fiscal year 2004 and 2005 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and were included in all operating segments. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2003.

PAGE 69 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 23, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington August 23, 2005 PAGE 70 Table of Contents Part II
