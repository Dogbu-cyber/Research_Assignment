Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies” of this report. We operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks. We operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. Pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might PAGE 16 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the United States and other countries. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. While we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues. General economic and geo-political risks may affect our revenue and profitability. Inflation, softness in corporate information technology spending, or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make, or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses. These factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. We have limited insurance. We maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. Because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2006, the face value of captive insurance arrangements was $2.0 billion. Actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles, exclusions, other restrictions, and claims. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. We store and process significant amounts of personally identifiable information as we offer a large array of products and services to our customers. It is possible that our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data. Perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products. Other risks that may affect our business. Other factors that may affect our performance may include: • sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor; • our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; • the continued availability of third-party distribution channels for MSN service and other online offerings; and • disruption to our operations as a result of weather-related events. PAGE 17 Table of Contents Part I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2006 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices consist of approximately 11.0 million square feet of office building space located in King County, Washington: 8.5 million square feet of owned space that is situated on approximately 500 acres of land we own in our corporate campus and approximately 2.5 million square feet of space we lease. We own approximately 533,000 square feet of office building space domestically (outside of the Puget Sound corporate campus) and lease many sites domestically totaling approximately 2.7 million square feet of office building space. We occupy many sites internationally, totaling approximately 6.9 million square feet that is leased and approximately 883,000 square feet that is owned. These facilities include our European Operations Center that leases a 187,000 square foot campus in Dublin, Ireland, a 56,000 square foot disk duplication facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and a 159,000 square foot facility in Singapore for our Asia Pacific Operations Center and Regional headquarters. Leased office building space includes the following locations: Tokyo, Japan 408,000 square feet; Unterschleissheim, Germany 381,000 square feet; Les Ulis, France 262,000 square feet; Reading, England 241,000 square feet; and Mississauga, Canada 161,000 square feet. In addition to the above locations, we have various product development facilities, both domestically and internationally, as described in “Operations” above. Our facilities are fully used for current operations of all segments, and suitable additional space is available to accommodate expansion needs. We own 63 acres of land in Issaquah, Washington, which can accommodate 1.2 million square feet of office space and we have an agreement with the City of Redmond under which we may develop an additional 2.2 million square feet of facilities at our campus in Redmond, Washington. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On May 22, 2006, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”) denied our motion for reconsideration of the formal written ruling against us in its competition law investigation of the company. As part of its decision, however, the KFTC dropped the requirement prohibiting us from including Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger, or any feature with similar functionality, in any product other than the Windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. Our request to stay the KFTC corrective order was denied on July 31, 2006. Our appeal of the KFTC’s decision to the Seoul High Court is still pending. On July 12, 2006, the European Commission announced its determination that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements in its 2004 Decision against us, and levied a fine of €281 million ($351 million). We intend to appeal this fine to the Court of First Instance. We have completed the written and oral procedures in our appeal of the Commission’s underlying March 2004 decision finding Microsoft in violation of European competition law and accompanying €497 million ($605 million) fine and are awaiting a decision by the Court of First Instance. See Note 17 – Contingencies in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding other legal proceedings in which we are involved. ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005, AND 2004 OVERVIEW The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (“Notes”). We develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world. Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, Home and Entertainment has generated over 40% of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future. We intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems. We also are increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – the easiest to deploy and manage and most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership. We continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business, including business solutions, mobile computing, communication, entertainment, and others that we believe may contribute to our long-term growth. We also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products. We believe that delivering innovative and high-value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. We believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long-term growth by delivering innovative products, creating opportunities for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, putting some of our most significant legal cases behind us, and improving our internal business processes. Our focus in fiscal year 2007 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. Key market opportunities include: • Strengthening core businesses through new product launches, upgrades, making inroads against software piracy, and extending PC accessibility to new consumers in emerging markets. • Succeeding in adjacent businesses by offering extensions of our technologies targeted towards specific customer needs – either as new products or as higher-value versions of existing products. • Entering new markets as we redefine how people create, deliver, and experience entertainment. • Delivering software services through online consumer services and services for businesses that enable workers to collaborate interactively. PAGE 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games and Internet service offerings. We expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. As open source software development and distribution evolves, we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competing products that are based on open source software. We believe that Microsoft’s share of server unit operating systems increased in fiscal year 2006. Summary of Results for Fiscal Years 2006, 2005, and 2004 (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 44,282 $ 39,788 $ 36,835 11% 8% Operating income $ 16,472 $ 14,561 $ 9,034 13% 61% Our revenue growth for fiscal year 2006 was driven primarily by growth in SQL Server following the launch of SQL Server 2005 in the second quarter, Windows Server and other server applications, increased Xbox revenue resulting from the Xbox 360 launch in the second quarter, growth in licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 11% to 13% during fiscal year 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year. Revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. The November 2004 launch of the “Halo 2” Xbox game also contributed to overall revenue growth for the company. Total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.08 billion decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage in fiscal year 2005. This revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired. Fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of Windows client operating systems through OEMs, Windows Server operating systems, Office and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments. The worldwide PC shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13% and the Windows server shipment was estimated at 18% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. This resulted in approximately $1.10 billion growth in total revenue. Operating income for fiscal year 2006 increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by a $1.62 billion increase in cost of revenue primarily related to Xbox 360 and a $1.26 billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $682 million or 7% resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount over the past twelve months. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $733 million or 30% reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense. Operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 due to a decline in stock-based compensation expense; increased revenue in Server and Tools, Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. In addition, strong sales of Halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the Home and Entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. The $3.29 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. General and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of Sun PAGE 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the European Commission in fiscal year 2004. This effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with IBM, Novell, Gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters. In fiscal year 2004, the operating income decline was caused primarily by $2.53 billion of legal charges and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program, mainly offset by an increase in revenue. We implemented changes in employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JPMorgan”). The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. As a result of these changes, stock-based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and we expect stock-based compensation expense related to stock options to continue to decrease in fiscal year 2007. Fiscal Year 2007 Outlook In fiscal year 2007, we expect continued double digit revenue growth primarily as a result of the upcoming launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow between 8% and 10%. We expect that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. We estimate worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 10% and 12% in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. We do not expect a significant impact from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2007. We expect our operating income growth rate to lag our revenue growth rate in the first half of fiscal year 2007 due to an increasing mix of Xbox 360 console revenue and related costs, coupled with significant investments in preparation for the launches of our flagship products. We expect this trend to reverse in the second half of the fiscal year when we expect operating income to grow faster than revenue. SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) Our seven segments were Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. On July 17, 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in September 2005. These changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004. The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. The segment information appearing in Note 18 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company’s internal management reporting, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation. Client (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 13,209 $ 12,151 $ 11,556 9% 5% Operating income $ 10,203 $ 9,464 $ 8,740 8% 8% PAGE 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. Client revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in OEM revenue driven by 17% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. During the year, the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed (“OEM Premium Mix”) increased two percentage points to 52%. OEM revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other Microsoft channels. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the OEM Premium Mix, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders. Client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in OEM license units and $886 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The OEM Premium Mix remained flat at 50% of total OEM Windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. Revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue. Client operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and Windows Vista pre-launch programs. Headcount-related costs increased 6% in fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue and a $444 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with “Start Something,” a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of Windows Vista. Server and Tools (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 11,467 $ 9,938 $ 8,590 15% 16% Operating income $ 4,323 $ 3,291 $ 1,474 31% 123% Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (“CAL”) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools revenue increased during fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in SQL Server, Windows Server, and Core CAL. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. Revenue is impacted by overall server hardware shipments which we estimate grew 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, and developer tools, training and certification revenue grew $1.31 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for PAGE 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 the year. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $218 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services. In fiscal year 2005, Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.10 billion or 17%. Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared to the previous year. Foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for $284 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned. Server and Tools operating income increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses. Excluding headcount-related costs, sales and marketing expenses increased $274 million due to additional spending to support long-term strategies and marketing expenses primarily related to the launch of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Total Server and Tools headcount-related costs increased 5% related to both an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. In fiscal year 2005, Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and a $1.07 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This increase was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Information Worker (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 11,756 $ 11,169 $ 10,748 5% 4% Operating income $ 8,285 $ 8,025 $ 7,458 3% 8% Information Worker primarily consists of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers, solutions, and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CAL, and other information worker products including Office Communications Server and OneNote. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $521 million or 5% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, while OEM revenue increased $66 million or 4%. Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting a $269 million or 3% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan, a $91 million or 6% increase in OEM revenue, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by reduced Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005, offset by a $663 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Information Worker operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by a $283 million or 15% increase in sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and a $71 million or 10% increase in research and development expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 14% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts and research and development investments in future products and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Information Worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a $304 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of Office 2003. This decline was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs as a result of an increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.

The main products consist of enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) solutions, customer relationship management (“CRM”) software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program (“MSPP”), and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions and Partners (“SMS&P”), which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 driven by new users for Microsoft CRM and existing Dynamics ERP customers purchasing functionality and user licenses. The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by 25% decline in services revenue. The software revenue increase was driven by 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue and was attributed to growth in ERP and CRM solutions and an increase in MSPP subscriptions. Microsoft Business Solutions operating income increased in fiscal year 2006 reflecting the increase in revenue accompanied by a $56 million decrease in sales and marketing expense as a result of decreased net SMS&P spending. Headcount-related costs increased 3% reflecting both a 10% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a $175 million decline in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in amortization of acquired intangibles. The reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental costs in the SMS&P organization. In addition, we increased our marketing and product development spending in our ERP and CRM portfolios.

MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. In fiscal year 2006, we launched MSN adCenter – our internally developed advertising platform – in certain international markets and throughout the U.S. where it now serves 100 percent of paid search traffic on our online properties. We believe MSN adCenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded PAGE 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. We announced in fiscal year 2006, Windows Live™, a set of Internet services and software designed to improve the users’ connected experience, including Windows Live™ Local and Windows Live Messenger. MSN revenue decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and transaction services other than access. As of June 30, 2006, MSN had 2.1 million access subscribers compared with 2.7 million at June 30, 2005. In addition, MSN had over 261 million active Hotmail accounts and over 243 million active Messenger accounts as of June 30, 2006. The increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the transition to adCenter. In fiscal year 2005, MSN revenue increased reflecting $193 million or 16% growth in advertising revenue primarily as a result of industry and market growth and continued growth of MSN display advertising revenue and $84 million or 88% growth in subscription and transaction services revenue. These increases were partially offset by the search clarity in advertising program, the impact of the homepage redesign, and a decline of $219 million or 24% in access revenue, driven by the continued migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. MSN operating income decreased in fiscal year 2006 due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continue to invest in MSN adCenter, Windows Live, and other new platforms. Headcount-related costs increased 25% reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. In fiscal year 2005, MSN operating income increased mainly due to a $241 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, reduced costs associated with the Internet Access business, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. Partially offsetting the decreased expenses were increased headcount-related costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.

These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to unit volume increases in major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, partially offset by a decline in shipments for stand-alone PDAs. In fiscal year 2006, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $55 million or 37% while revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $49 million or 47%, which was primarily due to the product being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. Unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal PAGE 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone PDAs. In fiscal year 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $46 million or 45% and revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21%. Unit volume increases in major product lines drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, and increased growth in shipments for standalone PDAs. Mobile and Embedded Devices generated operating income for fiscal year 2006 as opposed to the operating loss in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a $42 million or 21% increase in both research and development and general and administrative expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 15% reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared to fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a $95 million decrease in stock-based compensation, as well as the growth in revenue and a decrease in sales and marketing expense. This improvement was partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased headcount, and increased investment in research and development. Home and Entertainment (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Revenue $ 4,256 $ 3,140 $ 2,737 36% 15% Operating loss $ (1,262 ) $ (485 ) $ (1,337 ) (160)% 64% Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, CPxG (consumer software and hardware products), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360. Revenue from the first generation of Xbox products has declined and is expected to continue to decline as a result of the introduction of Xbox 360. Home and Entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the launch of the Xbox 360 console partially offset by a decline in first party Xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. We sold approximately 5 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2006. The revenue growth was also attributable to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in PC games sales due to significant new game releases, especially “Age of Empires III”, and an increase in MSTV revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006. Revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in Xbox revenue. Halo 2 was introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and generated over $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2005. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared to fiscal year 2004 due to lower PC games software sales. Home and Entertainment operating loss increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue resulting from the number of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. Our fiscal year 2006 operating loss increased due to the significant impact of Halo 2 in fiscal year 2005. Headcount-related costs increased 5% reflecting both a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The fiscal year 2005 operating loss decreased primarily due to an increase in high margin Xbox software sales, lower Xbox console units costs, a $90 million lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a $219 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with Xbox 360 console development and related launch efforts.

Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies. Corporate-level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2006, primarily reflecting a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by an $84 million increase in headcount-related costs. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 including settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, and the €281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft, as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc., Gateway, IBM, and other antitrust and competition law matters. Headcount-related costs increased 5% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. Corporate-level expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005, primarily as a result of a $736 million reduction in stock-based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004 which included a $1.92 billion charge for a settlement with the Sun Microsystems, Inc., and the fine of €497 million ($605 million) imposed by the European Commission. Change to Financial Reporting Structure On July 17, 2006, we announced that effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, we will report our businesses under five operating segments, reflecting completion of the previously announced changes in our organizational structure and how we will manage our business beginning in fiscal year 2007. Each of the five segments will be organized under one of the three operating divisions announced earlier in fiscal year 2006: • Platforms and Services Division • Microsoft Business Division • Entertainment and Devices Division The five operating segments are described below. The first three of these will comprise the Platforms and Services Division. Client will include the former Client segment. Products will include Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools will include the former Server and Tools segment, excluding the Exchange Server business and certain client access licenses related to products residing in the Microsoft Business Division. Products will include the Windows Server operating system, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Consulting Services, product support services, Visual Studio, System Center products, the Forefront security family of products, and Biz Talk Server, among others. Online Services Business will include the former MSN segment and Windows Live. Products will include MSN Search, MapPoint, MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services, MSN Mobile Services, and Windows Live. Microsoft Business Division will include the former Information Worker and Microsoft Business Solutions segments, as well as the Exchange Server business and certain client access licenses, formerly included in the Server and Tools segment. Products will include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CAL, Microsoft Live Meeting, One Note, Office Communication Server, Microsoft Dynamics AX, Microsoft PAGE 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Microsoft Dynamics SL, Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System, Microsoft Partner Program, and Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting. Entertainment and Devices Division will include the former Home and Entertainment and Mobile and Embedded Devices segments. Products will include Xbox 360, Xbox, Xbox Live, CPxG (consumer software and hardware products), IPTV, Windows Mobile software platform, Windows Embedded device operating system, and Windows Automotive. Our historical results under this new segmentation for the four quarters in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Revenue For the quarter ended For the quarter ended (In millions) September 30,2005 December 31,2005 March 31,2006 June 30,2006 Fiscal Year2006 September 30,2004 December 31,2004 March 31,2005 June 30,2005 Fiscal Year2005 Segments Client $ 3,187 $ 3,459 $ 3,187 $ 3,376 $ 13,209 $ 2,980 $ 3,193 $ 2,964 $ 3,014 $ 12,151 Server and Tools 2,127 2,438 2,398 2,690 9,653 1,906 2,161 2,058 2,245 8,370 Online Services Business 564 594 561 580 2,299 559 606 581 598 2,344 Microsoft Business Division 3,283 3,689 3,608 3,908 14,488 3,086 3,413 3,384 3,637 13,520 Entertainment and Devices 580 1,657 1,146 1,250 4,633 658 1,445 633 667 3,403 Total revenue $ 9,741 $ 11,837 $ 10,900 $ 11,804 $ 44,282 $ 9,189 $ 10,818 $ 9,620 $ 10,161 $ 39,788 Operating Income / (Loss) For the quarter ended For the quarter ended (In millions) September 30,2005 December 31,2005 March 31, 2006 June 30, 2006 Fiscal Year2006 September 30,2004 December 31,2004 March 31, 2005 June 30, 2005 Fiscal Year2005 Segments Client $ 2,569 $ 2,638 $ 2,471 $ 2,504 $ 10,182 $ 2,387 $ 2,513 $ 2,331 $ 2,172 $ 9,403 Server and Tools 606 762 746 903 3,017 455 660 515 479 2,109 Online Services Business 81 58 (26 ) (190 ) (77 ) 79 130 101 101 411 Microsoft Business Division 2,251 2,466 2,414 2,544 9,675 2,160 2,355 2,316 2,285 9,116 Entertainment and Devices (182 ) (296 ) (422 ) (437 ) (1,337 ) (202 ) 28 (198 ) (235 ) (607 ) Corporate-Level Activity (1,279 ) (971 ) (1,295 ) (1,443 ) (4,988 ) (1,385 ) (937 ) (1,736 ) (1,813 ) (5,871 ) Total operating income $ 4,046 $ 4,657 $ 3,888 $ 3,881 $ 16,472 $ 3,494 $ 4,749 $ 3,329 $ 2,989 $ 14,561 Our outlook for fiscal year 2007 based on the five operating segments is as follows: Client We expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to our upcoming launch of Windows Vista. We expect revenue generated from OEMs to grow slower than the PC hardware market due to increased concentration among larger OEMs, consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments, and relatively faster growth in emerging markets. We expect PC shipments to grow 8% to 10% for fiscal year 2007. We believe that PC unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets. Server and Tools We expect continued momentum from recent product launches and the expansion of our products in security, management and designer tools will help drive our overall revenue growth in fiscal year 2007. We estimate overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10% to 12% in fiscal year 2007. However, we face competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications. PAGE 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Online Services Business We expect increased growth in display advertising revenue as the portals, channels, and communications services continue to expand globally and the overall Internet advertising industry continues to expand. Our search revenue is expected to grow in fiscal year 2007 as a result of continued ramp up of adCenter. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2007. Microsoft Business Division We expect Microsoft Business Division revenue to grow in fiscal year 2007. We feel that our customers’ continued preference to purchase annuity contracts indicates enthusiasm for the 2007 Microsoft Office system. We also expect continued demand for our Dynamics products, building on the fiscal 2006 momentum. Entertainment and Devices Division We expect revenue to increase from fiscal year 2006 due to the increased availability of the Xbox 360 console unit during the entire fiscal year, including the second holiday season after the launch in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, we expect to introduce a music and entertainment device, the first in a new family of hardware and software products for the consumer market. The availability of a commercial IPTV product is expected to drive significant growth in MSTV revenue across several geographies. Revenue from existing mobility and embedded devices is expected to increase due to unit volume increases of Windows Mobile software driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices and Windows Embedded operating systems. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Xbox 360 console unit costs are expected to decline. As we implement our long-term growth strategy, we expect to increase our level of spending in four key areas in fiscal year 2007: increased product costs associated with Xbox consoles; marketing and field sales spending including launch costs; quickening the pace of development in growth areas such as business intelligence, security, management and unified communications (including acquisitions); and increased costs to execute on our online services strategy. While these investments will translate into increased operating expenses in fiscal year 2007, we believe they will help lay the groundwork for future growth and profitability. Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Cost of revenue $ 7,650 $ 6,031 $ 6,596 27% (9)% As a percent of revenue 17% 15% 18% 2ppt (3)ppt Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue in fiscal year 2006 increased mainly due to a $1.64 billion increase in Home and Entertainment as a result of an increase in the number of total Xbox consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs. Cost of revenue in fiscal year 2005 decreased due to a $363 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $140 million reduction in costs associated with a decrease in the MSN Internet Access subscriber base, and a $169 million reduction in other product costs mainly due to Xbox consoles cost efficiency, partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services costs.

Research and development expenses also PAGE 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased development costs associated with new and upcoming offerings such as MSN adCenter, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Windows Vista, Xbox 360, and corporate research activities. Headcount-related costs increased 3% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 17% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to a $1.88 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This expense decline was partially offset by increased headcount and product development costs associated with the Xbox 360 console and related games, SQL Server 2005, Windows Vista, and product development in Mobile and Embedded Devices. Sales and Marketing (In millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 PercentChange 2006 versus 2005 PercentChange 2005 versus 2004 Sales and marketing $ 9,818 $ 8,563 $ 8,195 15% 4% As a percent of revenue 22% 22% 22% –ppt –ppt Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased headcount-related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. Headcount-related costs increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. For fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount-related costs from increased headcount and general salary increases; higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing, and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the “Start Something” campaign; launch of “Halo 2”; and launch arrangements for Xbox 360. The increase was offset mainly by a $660 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

General and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during fiscal year 2006 as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during fiscal year 2005. Headcount-related costs increased 7% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative costs decreased in fiscal year 2005 primarily reflecting decreased stock-based compensation expense and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $277 million of stock-based compensation expense as compared to $664 million in fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2005, we recognized $2.31 billion in legal charges as compared to $2.83 billion in fiscal year 2004. PAGE 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Investment Income and Other The components of investment income and other were as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Dividends and interest $ 1,510 $ 1,460 $ 1,892 Net gains on investments 161 856 1,563 Net losses on derivatives (99 ) (262 ) (268 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other 218 13 (25 ) Investment income and other $ 1,790 $ 2,067 $ 3,162 For fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004, and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006. Dividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004, and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend. For fiscal year 2006, net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed-income investments and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed-income investments. Net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed-income investments, higher other-than-temporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on July 20, 2006. Net gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on December 2, 2004. Net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $82 million in fiscal year 2004. Net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, among other factors, we evaluate general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net losses on derivatives were as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net gain/(losses) on equity derivatives $ 192 $ (202 ) $ 118 Net gains on commodity derivatives 101 46 – Net losses on interest rate derivatives (79 ) (53 ) (102 ) Net losses on foreign currency contracts (313 ) (53 ) (284 ) Net losses on derivatives $ (99 ) $ (262 ) $ (268 ) During fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non-designated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior PAGE 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices. These gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts. The net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year 2006 are primarily due to changes in the market value of non-designated equity derivatives. Gains and losses arising from non-designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income Net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income. Net losses on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. Gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005. Derivative losses were $268 million in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into an agreement with NBC Universal, Inc. (“NBC”) that restructured our joint venture relationships for MSNBC Cable L.L.C. (“CJV”) and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. (“IJV”). As a result, we divested 32% of CJV for $331 million and NBC acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. In addition, we modified our agreement with NBC to grant to IJV a U.S. content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both NBC and Microsoft for local and non-U.S. news content. As part of the MSNBC restructuring agreements, we paid a $200 million fee to effectively terminate IJV’s prior content license agreement and we also prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to NBC. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, NBC exercised its option to buy our remaining 18% interest in CJV. For fiscal year 2006, we recognized a net gain of $195 million related to the above transactions. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 31% as compared to 26% for fiscal year 2005. During fiscal year 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits. The increased rate in fiscal year 2006 resulted primarily from the European Commission fine of €281 million ($351 million) which is not tax deductible, and a lower rate in fiscal year 2005 as a result of reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an Internal Revenue Service examination for fiscal year 1997 – 1999 and a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2004 was 33%. Financial Condition Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $34.16 billion and $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. This investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. Equity and other investments were $9.23 billion and $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.90 billion at June 30, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position. PAGE 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, advertising, and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006, increased $1.74 billion from June 30, 2005, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.66 billion, a $53 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services. The following table outlines the expected recognition of $10.9 billion of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006: (In millions) Recognition ofUnearned Revenue Three months ended: September 30, 2006 $ 3,483 December 31, 2006 2,687 March 31, 2007 1,899 June 30, 2007 1,069 Thereafter 1,764 Unearned revenue $ 10,902 Cash Flows Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2006 decreased 13% to $14.40 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a $987 million increase in inventory and product costs related to Xbox 360 and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16% growth in headcount. These factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11% revenue growth and $1.74 billion increase in unearned revenue. Cash used in financing was $20.56 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $20.52 billion from the previous year driven by a $32.57 billion reduction in cash dividend payments. This impact was partially offset by an $11.15 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Net cash from investing was $8.00 billion in fiscal year 2006, a decrease of $7.02 billion from fiscal year 2005 driven primarily by an $8.93 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase, sales, and maturities of investments and a $766 million increase in additions to property and equipment. These factors were partially offset by $3.12 billion of cash proceeds from our securities lending program. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14% to $16.61 billion primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8% revenue growth combined with a 12% increase in unearned revenue. Cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately $1.8 billion lower than in the previous year, adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7% increase in full-time employees. Cash used for financing was $41.08 billion in fiscal year 2005, driven by $36.11 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in fiscal year 2004. The increase was also partially driven by $8.06 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases, an increase of $4.67 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year, reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005, an increase of 188.5 million shares compared to the previous year. Net cash from investing was $15.03 billion in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $18.37 billion from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to a $23.59 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $5.32 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity. PAGE 35 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the previous year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004. Cash used for investing was $3.34 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $3.88 billion from fiscal year 2003. We have no material long-term debt. Stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2006, was $40.10 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $234 million on June 30, 2006. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $276 million, $299 million, and $331 million fiscal year 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. In fiscal year 2006, our Board of Directors declared $0.35 per share cash dividends, with $2.69 billion paid as of June 30, 2006. A quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share (or $906 million) was declared by our Board of Directors on June 21, 2006 to be paid to shareholders of record as of August 17, 2006, on September 14, 2006. On July 20, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004 to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock. The repurchases were made using our cash resources. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 754 million shares, or $19.75 billion, of our common stock under this plan. On July 20, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on August 17, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of the common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the ongoing share repurchase program, previously announced on July 20, 2006, had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, the company is authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. We believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the PAGE 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2006: (In millions)(1) Payments due by period Fiscal Years 2007 2008-2010 2011-2013 2014 andthereafter Total Long-term debt $ – $ – $ – $ – $ – Construction commitments(2)(4) 234 – – – 234 Lease obligations: Capital leases – – – – – Operating leases(3) 250 436 158 41 885 Purchase commitments(4) 2,219 9 – – 2,228 Other long-term liabilities(5) 4 66 1 – 71 Total contractual obligations $ 2,707 $ 511 $ 159 $ 41 $ 3,418 (1) We have excluded the $970 million long-term contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in Note 17 – Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. (2) We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (3) Our future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases comprise the majority of the operating lease obligations presented above. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. (4) The amount presented above as purchase and construction commitments includes all known open purchase orders and all known contracts that are take-or-pay contracts. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and our cash flows from operations. (5) We have excluded other obligations of $5.22 billion from other long-term liabilities presented above as the amount that will be settled in cash is not known. We have also excluded unearned revenue of $1.76 billion. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. We elected to adopt the transition method as described in the FSP as of July 1, 2005. This method change did not have an impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50% probability threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. We are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our financial statements. PAGE 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 In June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43”. EITF Issue No. 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. EITF Issue No. 06-2 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. Elective retrospective application is also permitted. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this guidance and the method of adoption that will be used. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation. We account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. PAGE 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 We account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. PAGE 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 7 Statement of Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and management’s report on its assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors and our independent auditors to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Steven A. Ballmer Chief Executive Officer Christopher P. Liddell Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer PAGE 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity, and commodity price risks. A portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position. We hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed-income securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk. The portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. Commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk. We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies, equities, and commodities is geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert to maturity value over time. VaR is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding’s market value to a range of over 1,000 equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. The exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. The VaR is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. We hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put-call collars. In these arrangements, we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike, in exchange for the premium received for the sold call. We also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. We have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods. At the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006, we changed the methodology we use to calculate VaR. We previously used a Monte Carlo simulation-based methodology to calculate VaR. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we adopted a factor-based parametric methodology. The factor-based parametric methodology can be performed more frequently (resulting in more timely data), divides the aggregated VaR into its component risk factor groups, and is incrementally more accurate than the previously used simulation-based methodology in evaluating diversification effects of commodity risk factors and interactions between equity and currency factors. While we believe the efficiencies gained by changing to the parametric methodology are significant, we do not believe this methodology produces results that are significantly different from the simulation-based methodology. The VaR amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio. Losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VaR by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the VaR analysis. VaR amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. VaR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. These VaR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. We use historical data to estimate VaR. Given the reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation in VaR is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. PAGE 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006: (In millions) Year ended June 30, 2006 Risk Categories 2006 2005 Average High Low Interest rates $ 66 $ 88 $ 82 $ 127 $ 62 Currency rates 91 52 33 91 11 Equity prices 88 164 116 168 84 Commodity prices 12 14 15 18 12 Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $158 million at June 30, 2006 and $195 million at June 30, 2005. The total VaR is 38% less at June 30, 2006 and 39% less at June, 30 2005 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.

PAGE 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product life cycles, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. We revised our expense classification policies during fiscal year 2006 which resulted in reclassifications of certain operating expenses. We have reclassified the prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on total operating expenses, operating income and our net income. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped, with a portion of the revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing PAGE 47 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (Software Assurance). In addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions. Revenue related to our Xbox game console is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox platform is recognized when manufactured for the game publishers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Revenue for fixed price services arrangements is recognized based on percentage of completion. Costs related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, PC games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material, and accordingly, we have expensed all research and development costs when incurred. SALES AND MARKETING Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.23 billion in fiscal year 2006, $995 million in fiscal year 2005, and $904 million in fiscal year 2004. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments may include both debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected in OCI. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. PAGE 48 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. For options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Certain non-U.S. dollars denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Equities Price Risk. Equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values and cash flows on certain equity securities. We determine the security, or forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Certain options, futures and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are also used to manage equity exposures. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. We use exchange-traded option and future contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, to hedge interest rate risk. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. In addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets are not taken at the earliest available delivery date. All derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change. PAGE 49 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Balance atbeginning of period Charged to costs and expenses Write-offs and other Balance at end of period 2004 $ 242 $ 44 $ (120 ) $ 166 2005 166 48 (43 ) 171 2006 171 40 (69 ) $ 142 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less. GOODWILL Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented. NOTE 2 UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items: Volume licensing programs – Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Undelivered elements – Represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product’s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. PAGE 50 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Other – Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Business Solutions maintenance and enhancement billings, Xbox Live and other billings that are accounted for as subscriptions, and other agreements where Microsoft is committed to the delivery of future enhancements, products, or services, including the TV platform.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. At June 30, 2005 unrealized losses of $258 million consisted of: $112 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $13 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed income securities, $90 million related to domestic equity securities and $43 million related to international equity securities. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2006. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2006 the recorded basis of these investments was $41 million, and their estimated fair value was $41 million. At June 30, 2005 the recorded basis of these investments was $1.05 billion, and their estimated fair value was $1.27 billion. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. The maturities of debt securities, including fixed maturity securities, at June 30, 2006 were as follows: (In millions) Cost basis Estimated fairvalue Due in one year or less $ 5,680 $ 5,686 Due after one year through five years 12,011 11,971 Due after five years through ten years 6,111 6,041 Due after ten years 6,741 6,683 Total $ 30,543 $ 30,381 NOTE 4 INVESTMENT INCOME AND OTHER The components of investment income and other were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2006 2005 2004 Dividends and interest $ 1,510 $ 1,460 $ 1,892 Net gains on investments 161 856 1,563 Net losses on derivatives (99 ) (262 ) (268 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other 218 13 (25 ) Investment income and other $ 1,790 $ 2,067 $ 3,162 Net gains on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $408 million in fiscal year 2006, $152 million in fiscal year 2005, and $82 million in fiscal year 2004. The increase in other-than-temporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the $20 billion tender offer announced on July 20, 2006. Realized gains and (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $1.11 billion and $(531) million in fiscal year 2006, $1.38 billion and $(376) million in fiscal year 2005, and $2.16 billion and $(518) million in fiscal year 2004. NOTE 5 DERIVATIVES For derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, did not have a significant impact on earnings PAGE 53 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 for fiscal years 2006, 2005, or 2004. During fiscal year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $79 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $116 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2004, $31 million in gains on fair value hedges from changes in time value and $325 million in losses on cash flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and included in investment income and other. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized. During fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. During fiscal year 2005, $57 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $33 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other. During fiscal year 2004, $14 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and no derivative gains or losses were reclassified to investment income and other. We estimate that $133 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. No significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements range from two to ten years – representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions, computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. Land is not depreciated. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, depreciation expense was $863 million, $723 million, and $647 million, respectively. The majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.

Our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2006 and 2005. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests. During fiscal year 2005, we had no material acquisitions. During the fiscal year 2006, we acquired the following entities for a total consideration of $689 million, which was primarily paid in cash: • Frontbridge Technologies, Inc., a California-based provider of managed services that addresses corporate e-mail compliance, security, and availability requirements; • Teleo, Inc., a California-based voice over Internet protocol software and services provider; • MediaStreams.com AG, a Zurich, Switzerland-based developer of PC-based voice over Internet protocol communication systems and peripheral equipment; • Lionhead Studios Ltd., a Guildford, England-based software studio specializing in PC game development; • Vexcel Corporation, a Colorado-based imagery technology and systems provider; • Massive Corporation, a New York-based developer of video game advertising; • ProClarity Corporation, an Idaho-based developer of advanced analysis and visualization technologies for business platforms; and • 14 various other entities specializing in areas such as application security, digital access management, and networking solutions. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $592 million of goodwill. None of that amount is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was assigned to our operating segments as follows: $29 million to Server & Tools, $263 million to MSN, $31 million to Client, $246 million to Information Worker, and $23 million to Home and Entertainment. We also recorded $125 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 3.25 years, and $26 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average amortization period of 4.5 years. All of the entities have been consolidated into our financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. None of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are material to our consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, pro forma information has not been included.

The 2005 other reconciling items include a $179 million repatriation tax benefit under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2004 other reconciling items include the $208 million benefit from the resolution of an issue remanded by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the impact of the $605 million non-deductible European Commission fine. PAGE 57 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30 2006 2005 Deferred income tax assets: Stock-based compensation expense $ 3,630 $ 3,994 Other expense items 1,451 1,751 Unearned revenue 1,028 915 Impaired investments 989 861 Other revenue items 102 213 Other – 173 Deferred income tax assets $ 7,200 $ 7,907 Deferred income tax liabilities: International earnings $ (1,715 ) $ (1,393 ) Unrealized gain on investments (801 ) $ (1,169 ) Other (133 ) (23 ) Deferred income tax liabilities (2,649 ) (2,585 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 4,551 $ 5,322 Reported as: Current deferred tax assets $ 1,940 $ 1,701 Long-term deferred tax assets 2,611 3,621 Net deferred income tax assets $ 4,551 $ 5,322 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $505 million resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the United States. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $151 million. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was enacted in October 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings by providing an elective 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Under these provisions, we repatriated approximately $780 million in dividends subject to the elective 85% dividends received deduction and we recorded a corresponding tax provision benefit of $179 million from the reversal of previously provided U.S. deferred tax liabilities on these unremitted foreign subsidiary earnings in 2005. The dividend was paid in June 2006. Income taxes paid were $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2006, $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2005, and $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2004. Tax Contingencies. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions, the non-current portion of which is included in other long-term liabilities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter, which matters result primarily from inter-company transfer pricing, restructuring of foreign PAGE 58 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 operations, tax benefits from the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extra Territorial Income tax rules, the amount of research and experimentation tax credits claimed, state income taxes, and certain other matters. Although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain; therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, the final determination of tax audit settlements and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. If we were to settle an audit or a matter under litigation, it could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed and closed its audits of our consolidated federal income tax returns through 1999. The IRS is currently conducting an audit of our consolidated federal income tax return for tax years 2000 through 2003.

Because the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Stock-Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 123(R) were materially consistent under our equity plans, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) did not have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The stock-based compensation and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total stock-based compensation $ 1,715 $ 2,448 $ 5,734 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation $ 600 $ 857 $ 2,007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). The administrative committee under the plan approved a change to the common stock purchase discount and approved the elimination of the related look back period and a change to quarterly purchase periods that became effective July 1, 2004. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock may presently be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal year 2006 employees purchased 17.2 million shares at an average price of $23.02 per share. At June 30, 2006, 141.9 million shares were reserved for future issuance. During fiscal year 2005 employees purchased 16.4 million shares at average prices of $23.33 per share. Under the plan in effect previous to fiscal year 2005, shares of our common stock could be purchased at six month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month period. Employees could purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal year 2004 employees purchased 16.7 million shares at average prices of $22.74 per share. Savings Plan. We have a savings plan in the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $178 million, $154 million, and $141 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. PAGE 61 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Stock Plans. We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. At June 30, 2006, an aggregate of 812 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. The options transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JPMorgan”) (see below) in fiscal year 2004 have been removed from our plans; any options transferred to JPMorgan that expire without being exercised will not become available for grant under any of our plans. On November 9, 2004, our shareholders approved amendments to the stock plans that allowed our Board of Directors to adjust eligible options, unvested stock awards, and shared performance stock awards to maintain their pre-dividend value after the $3.00 special dividend. Additional awards were granted for options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards by the ratio of post- and pre-special dividend stock price as of the ex-dividend date. Strike prices for options were decreased by the same ratio. Stock-based compensation was not affected by this adjustment. As a result of this approval and payment of the $3.00 special dividend on December 2, 2004, an adjustment to the prices and number of shares of existing awards was made resulting in a total of 96 million options and 6.7 million stock awards being issued to adjust the outstanding awards. In addition, the target shared performance stock awards were increased by 3.5 million shares. We issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises. On July 20, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004 to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock. Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards. Stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. Our stock awards generally vest over a five-year period. Shared Performance Stock Awards (“SPSAs”) are a form of stock award in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. The performance period for SPSAs issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 (January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 for certain executive officers). Following the end of the performance period, the Board of Directors determined that the number of shares of stock awards to be issued was 37.0 million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. One-third of the awards will vest in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. An additional one-third of the awards will vest over each of the following two years. Because the SPSAs covered a three-year period, SPSAs issued in fiscal year 2005 and 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive SPSAs. The Company will grant SPSAs for fiscal year 2007 with a performance period of July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award will be determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage will be determined based on performance against metrics for the performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. An additional 15% of the total stock and stock awards will be available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award will vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares will vest over each of the following three years. We measure the fair value of SAs and SPSAs based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. SAs and SPSAs are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally five years) using the straight-line method. The fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Dividend per share $0.08 - $0.09 $0.08 $0.16 Interest rates range 3.2% - 5.3% 1.3% - 4.3% 0.9% - 4.2% The dividend per share amounts for fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 are quarterly dividend amounts. The dividend amount of $0.16 was the total dividend per share for fiscal year 2004. PAGE 62 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 During fiscal year 2006, the following activity occurred under our existing plans: Shares(in millions) WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value Stock awards: Nonvested balance at July 1, 2005 71.3 $ 23.92 Granted 47.3 24.70 Vested (15.7 ) 23.85 Forfeited (4.8 ) 23.60 Nonvested balance at June 30, 2006 98.1 $ 24.25 Shared performance stock awards: Nonvested balance at July 1, 2005 35.3 $ 23.54 Granted 3.1 24.80 Vested – – Forfeited (1.8 ) 24.92 Nonvested balance at June 30, 2006 36.6 $ 23.57 As of June 30, 2006, there were $1.69 billion and $383 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.1 years and 2.2 years, respectively. During the 12 months ended June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions, except fair values) Fiscal Year2005 Fiscal Year2004 Stock awards granted 41.0 32.6 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 24.03 $ 24.09 Shared performance stock awards granted 3.7 31.7 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 24.35 $ 23.62 Stock Options. In fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees stock awards rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. Since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. Nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan. Nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to our officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Approximately 2.9 million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal year 2006. No stock options were granted during the year ended June 30, 2005. In fiscal year 2004, approximately two million stock options were granted, nearly all of which were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. During fiscal year 2004, we completed an employee stock option transfer program whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested options with a strike price of $33.00 or higher to JPMorgan. The options transferred to JPMorgan were amended and restated upon transfer to contain terms and conditions typical of equity option transactions entered into between sophisticated financial counterparties at arm’s length using standard terms and definitions for equity derivatives. As a result of this program, we recorded additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. As of June 30, 2006, 237 million options transferred to JPMorgan remained outstanding but are excluded from the table below. These options have strike prices ranging from $28.60 to $89.58 per share and have expiration dates extending through December 2006. PAGE 63 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 Employee stock options outstanding were as follows: Shares(in millions) WeightedAverageExercise Price WeightedAverageRemainingContractualTerm (years) AggregateIntrinsicValue (in millions) Balance, July 1, 2005 864 $ 27.41 Granted 3 23.54 Exercised (76 ) 20.59 Canceled (33 ) 32.13 Forfeited (8 ) 23.01 Balance, June 30, 2006 750 $ 27.92 4.16 $ 452 Exercisable, June 30, 2006 673 $ 28.55 3.93 $ 343 Included in the options outstanding balance are approximately five million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. While these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise prices presented. These options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $11.26. As of June 30, 2006, there were $402 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately one year. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 the following activity occurred under our plans: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Total intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 491 $ 940 $ 2,971 Total fair value of stock awards vested 377 198 20 Cash received and income tax benefit from stock option exercises for fiscal year 2006 were $1.71 billion and $183 million, respectively. NOTE 15 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30 2006 2005 2004 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 12,599 $ 12,254 $ 8,168 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 10,438 10,839 10,803 Dilutive effect of employee stock options and awards 93 67 91 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 10,531 10,906 10,894 Earnings per share: Basic (A/B) $ 1.21 $ 1.13 $ 0.76 Diluted (A/C) $ 1.20 $ 1.12 $ 0.75 PAGE 64 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 For the years ended June 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004, 649 million, 854 million, and 1.2 billion shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended June 30, 2006, 1.2 million shared performance stock awards, out of the 36.6 million targeted amount outstanding, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in Note 14 – Employee Stock and Savings Plans. NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $276 million, $299 million, and $331 million, in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 Amount 2007 $ 250 2008 193 2009 138 2010 105 2011 and thereafter 199 $ 885 We have committed $234 million for constructing new buildings. In connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2006, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists. We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. Our product warranty accrual reflects management’s best estimate of our probable liability under its product warranties (primarily relating to the Xbox console). We determine the warranty accrual based on known product failures (if any), historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Our warranty accrual totals $10 million as of June 30, 2006. There has been no significant activity impacting the results of operations for any period presented. NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES Government competition law matters. On March 25, 2004, the European Commission issued a decision in its competition law investigation of us. The Commission concluded that we infringed European competition law by refusing to provide our competitors with licenses to certain protocol technology in the Windows server operating systems and by including streaming media playback functionality in Windows desktop operating systems. The Commission ordered us to make the relevant licenses to our technology available to our competitors and to develop PAGE 65 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 and make available a version of the Windows desktop operating system that does not include specified software relating to media playback. The decision also imposed a fine of €497 million, which resulted in a charge in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 of €497 million ($605 million). We filed an appeal of the decision to the Court of First Instance on June 6, 2004. On December 22, 2004, the Court ordered that we must comply with the decision pending review on appeal and we are taking steps to ensure we are in compliance. The hearing on the appeal occurred in April 2006. We continue to contest the conclusion that European competition law was infringed and will defend our position vigorously. In December 2005, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections that preliminarily concluded we were not in full compliance with the 2004 decree. In March 2006, the Commission conducted an oral hearing on the Statement of Objections and our response to the Statement. On July 12, 2006, the European Commission announced its determination that we had not complied with the technical documentation requirements of the 2004 Decision, and levied a fine of €281 million ($351 million). We will appeal this fine to the Court of First Instance. On December 7, 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (“KFTC”) announced a ruling in its investigation of us, holding that we abused a market dominant position and engaged in unfair trade practices under the Korean Fair Trade Law by incorporating instant messaging and media player functionality into the Windows PC operating system, and streaming media technologies into the Windows server operating system. The KFTC also announced the imposition of remedies, including a fine of approximately $34 million. The KFTC issued its formal written ruling and corrective order on February 23, 2006. The KFTC held that our integration of Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger in Windows PC operating systems and integration of Windows Media Services in Windows server operating systems constituted an abuse of monopoly power and unlawful tying in violation of the Korean Fair Trade Act. Under the order, which became effective August 24, 2006, we can no longer distribute Windows in Korea as currently designed. We are required to develop and distribute in Korea versions of Windows XP and its successors that do not include Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger functionality. In addition, we also may distribute a second modified version of Windows that contains the removed functionality, provided the second version includes promotional links in the user interface that will enable consumers to link to and download a select group of competing media players and instant messengers. We have appealed the KFTC’s decision to the Seoul High Court. On May 22, 2006, the KFTC denied our motion for reconsideration of its ruling. As part of that decision, the KFTC dropped the element of its ruling that prohibited us from including Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger, or any feature with similar functionality, in any product other than the Windows client operating system for which we have a 50% or greater market share. On August 23, 2006, we announced the release to manufacture of the mandated versions of Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Professional Edition. In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state Attorneys General have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues. Antitrust, and unfair competition, and overcharge class actions. A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state and federal courts on behalf of variously defined classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain software applications products. The federal cases have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for Maryland. These cases allege that we competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain software applications, and they seek to recover alleged overcharges for these products. To date, courts have dismissed all claims for damages in cases brought against us by indirect purchasers under federal law and in 18 states. Ten of those state court decisions have been affirmed on appeal. There was no appeal in five states. In addition, courts in two states refused to certify classes, essentially bringing the litigation to a close. Claims under federal law brought on behalf of foreign purchasers have been dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Maryland as have all claims brought on behalf of consumers seeking injunctive relief under federal law. The ruling on injunctive relief and the ruling dismissing the federal claims of indirect purchasers were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, together with a ruling denying certification of certain proposed classes of U.S. direct purchasers. On April 18, 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court decision dismissing the indirect purchaser claims. Courts in 18 states have ruled that indirect purchaser cases may proceed as class actions. In 2003, we reached an agreement with counsel for the California plaintiffs to settle all claims in 27 consolidated cases in that state. Under the settlement, class members will be able to obtain vouchers that entitle the class members to be reimbursed up to the face value of their vouchers for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers issued will depend on the number of class members who make a claim and are issued vouchers. Two-thirds of the value of vouchers unissued or unredeemed by class members will be made available to certain PAGE 66 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 schools in California in the form of vouchers that also may be redeemed for cash against purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware, software, and related services. We also have reached similar agreements to settle all claims in a number of other states. The settlements in these states are structured similarly to the California settlement, except that, among other differences, one-half of the value of vouchers unissued to class members will be made available to certain schools in the relevant states. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued in these settlements, including the California settlement, is approximately $2.5 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools who are issued and redeem vouchers. The settlements in Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia have received final court approval. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, with the actual cost dependent upon many unknown factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims process. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FIN No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, at June 30, 2006, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.5 billion less payments made to date of approximately $300 million, primarily for administrative expenses and legal fees. Other antitrust litigation and claims. On August 27, 2004, the City and County of San Francisco, the City of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, San Mateo, Contra Costa, and Santa Clara Counties filed a putative class action against us in San Francisco Superior Court. The action was brought on behalf of all governmental entities, agencies, and political subdivisions of the State of California that indirectly purchased our operating system or word processing and spreadsheet software during the period from February 18, 1995 to the date of trial in the action. The plaintiffs sought treble damages under California’s Cartwright Act and disgorgement of unlawful profits under its Unfair Competition Act resulting from our alleged combinations to restrain trade, deny competition, and monopolize the world markets for PC operating systems and word processing and spreadsheet applications (and productivity suites including these applications). We removed the case to the U.S. District Court for Maryland. Our motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on April 18, 2005 with leave to file an amended complaint alleging claims under the Cartwright Act based on conduct within the four-year statute of limitation the court ruled applies to the plaintiffs’ claims. We have obtained final approval of settlement of this case, which resolves all claims asserted in the lawsuit. On November 12, 2004, Novell, Inc. filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for Utah asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. On June 10, 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. An appeal of that ruling is now pending and the case is effectively stayed during the appeal. Patent and intellectual property claims. We are a defendant in more than 35 patent infringement cases that we are defending vigorously. In the case of Eolas Technologies, Inc. and University of California v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 2, 1999, the plaintiffs alleged infringement by the browser functionality of Windows. On August 11, 2003, the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately $520 million in damages for infringement from the date the plaintiffs’ patent was issued through September 2001. The plaintiffs are seeking an equitable accounting for damages from September 2001 to the present. On January 14, 2004, the trial court entered final judgment of $565 million, including post-trial interest of $45 million, and entered an injunction against distribution of any new infringing products, but stayed execution of the judgment and the injunction pending our appeal. We appealed and on March 2, 2005 the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision and vacated the judgment, ruling that the trial court had erred in excluding certain previous art evidence and ruling as a matter of law on other evidence. The appellate court also reversed the trial court’s decision that the inventors had not engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to reveal material previous art while obtaining the patent. We believe the total cost to resolve this case will not be material to our financial position or results of operations. The actual costs will be dependent upon many unknown factors such as the events of a retrial of the plaintiff’s claims. In Microsoft v. Lucent, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Diego on April 8, 2003, we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe any valid patent among a number of patents Lucent has been asserting against computer manufacturers that sell computers with our software pre-installed. The first in a series of back-to-back trials on the various patent groupings is currently set to begin on November 20, 2006. On March 28, 2006, Lucent filed a new lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court in San Diego, claiming that Xbox 360 violates one of the patents that earlier PAGE 67 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 had been dismissed from the older lawsuit. In response to Lucent’s new complaint, we asserted patent infringement counterclaims accusing Lucent of infringing ten Microsoft patents by its sales of various products. No trial date has been set in the new lawsuit. In Amado v. Microsoft, filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on March 7, 2003, the plaintiff has accused the link table functionality available in Microsoft Access when used with Microsoft Excel. After a jury trial, we were found to infringe one claim of the patent and damages of $8.9 million were awarded. The judge later found for us on our defense of laches, which reduced the damages award to $5.9 million. The court also imposed an injunction against further distribution of the accused feature as part of Microsoft Access, but stayed the injunction pending resolution of all appeals. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment on appeal and Microsoft intends to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court of one issue. In Z4 Technologies, Inc. v. Microsoft, the plaintiff alleged that Microsoft Windows and Office product activation functionality violates its patent rights. In April 2006, the jury rendered a $115 million verdict against us. In August 2006, the trial court increased damages by $25 million pursuant to the jury’s finding of willful infringement. We intend to appeal the verdict. In Veritas Operating Corporation v. Microsoft, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on May 18, 2006, a subsidiary of Symantec has filed an action asserting claims of trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and patent infringement relating to certain storage technologies. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this paragraph may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, adversely affecting distribution of our operating system or application products. The risks associated with an adverse decision may result in material settlements. Other. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2006, we had accrued aggregate liabilities totaling $1.0 billion in other current liabilities and $1.0 billion in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. While we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes which we estimate could be up to $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and on the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.

This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. Fiscal years 2005 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our seven segments are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. On July 17, 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in September 2005. These changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004. The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below: Client – Windows XP Professional and Home; Media Center Edition; Tablet PC Edition; and other standard Windows operating systems. Server and Tools –Windows Server operating system; Microsoft SQL Server; Exchange Server; Microsoft Consulting Services; product support services; Visual Studio; System Center products, Forefront security family of products; and Biz Talk. Information Worker – Microsoft Office; Microsoft Project; Microsoft Visio; SharePoint Portal Server client access licenses; Microsoft LiveMeeting; OneNote; and Office Communication Server. Microsoft Business Solutions – Microsoft Dynamics AX; Microsoft Dynamics CRM; Microsoft Dynamics GP; Microsoft Dynamics NAV; Microsoft Dynamics SL; Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System; Microsoft Partner Program; and Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting. MSN – MSN Search; MapPoint; MSN Internet Access; MSN Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, MSN Bill Pay, and MSN Radio Plus); and MSN Mobile Services. Mobile and Embedded Devices – Windows Mobile software platform; Windows Embedded device operating system; and Windows Automotive. Home and Entertainment – Xbox 360; Xbox; Xbox Live; CPxG (consumer software and hardware products); and IPTV. Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually PAGE 69 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, period-end cut-off timing, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies. Significant reconciling items were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30 2006 2005 2004 Operating income reconciling amounts: Legal settlements and contingent liabilities $ (1,321 ) $ (2,312 ) $ (2,832 ) Stock-based compensation expense (127 ) (1,042 ) (4,516 ) Revenue reconciling amounts 308 286 372 Corporate-level expenses(1) (3,742 ) (3,493 ) (3,128 ) Other (27 ) 201 385 Total $ (4,909 ) $ (6,360 ) $ (9,719 ) (1) Corporate-level expenses exclude legal settlements and contingent liabilities, stock-based compensation expense, and revenue reconciling amounts presented separately in those line items. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 11% of fiscal year 2006 and 10% of total fiscal year 2005 and 2004 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and were included in all operating segments.

As of June 30, 2006, the total amount of the fine was included in other current liabilities. On July 20, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs, comprised of a $20 billion tender offer which was completed on August 17, 2006, and an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 1.5% of our common stock outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a per share price of $24.75.

PAGE 72 Table of Contents Part II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 22, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington August 22, 2006 PAGE 73 Table of Contents Part II
